<H1>POSTING GUIDELINES for HCR RESOURCE GROUP</H1>

<H2>SECTION ONE (Sec 1): New Posts</H2>

<ol type="a">
    
    <li>
        We welcome posts that are:
<ol>
        <li>In short, thoughtful extensions of Dr. Richardson’s work.</li>
        <li>Thoughtful posts that relate contemporary events and politics to historical events. One of
        the themes of Dr. Richardson’s work is “we’ve been here before and survived.”</li>
        <li>Well-researched, thoughtful posts on Dr. Richardson’s idea of the American Paradox.</li>
        <li>Linked to resources for readings with additional info and further depth. In other words,
        something new and fresh related to topics Dr. Richardson has discussed.
        <br><br>
        <p>
            That’s what we want. If we like some of what you’ve written, you may get a request from us to
            edit your post and resubmit, to make it more relevant or interesting. This is common. We hope
            you will take us up on the challenge (see Sec 2a for more details).
        </p></li>
</ol>
    </li>
What we don’t welcome are:
1. Posts that amount to “here’s exactly what Dr. Richardson said, but in my own words,”
OR “here’s what Dr. Richardson discussed in her newsletter - which is what this news
article/person also says with different words”, UNLESS the aforementioned include
historical or new information, AND your personal comments or analysis telling us so.
2. Posts in which you assume “we’ll get” the historical significance or connections to Dr.
Richardson’s work. Please do the work and put it in writing. It’s on YOU to tell us WHY
we might care or find connection, not on us to click on the link before we figure it out..
Otherwise, it just looks like another news article to click based only on the headline.

3. Posts about or related to every conceivable political event that happened on a particular
day or news cycle. We can all read about those elsewhere. This is a big one. First, the
obvious: Yes, Mr. Trump (the president, Trump, doesn't matter as long as it's civil), does
something outrageous everyday, and this administration is failing in the eyes of many..
The fact that those truths exist, regardless of which side that truth seems to favor, does
not warrant a daily barrage of "and look at this too, here's another example/article/my
opinion of how terrible things are, and here's yet another article with (the same news,
different headline)" posts, followed by the hundreds of comments endorsing the outrage.
Second is simply: Not every news item belongs in, or is relevant to our focus here. We
have to be selective.
4. Sometimes your post is indeed very interesting and relevant, but there is a similar post in
the queue that we feel is a better representation or submission of that particular news
item/topic. We may even sometimes commission one of our expert members to
compose a post (for example, a retired trial lawyer for SCOTUS related news, or legal
issues). If we decline your post or this reason, something is going on in the background
that you’re unaware of. In such a case we encourage you to stay tuned and consider
your submission as a comment under a post with the same link or similar topics being
discussed.
5. Posts discussing conspiracy theories - even if you disagree with the theory and want to
discuss your disagreement. A conspiracy theory is an unsupported belief “that some
covert but influential organization is responsible for a circumstance or event.” A video on
YouTube is not evidence. These posts hurt our ranking on Facebook and make it more
difficult for us to be found

6. Posts that - while perhaps interesting and even perhaps relevant- are either introduced
in a way, or include a link that we believe may only invite outrage, rants, and/or may
provoke more emotional rather than reasoned and illuminating discussions.
7. Any post, no matter how interesting it appears, with only a link and/or quotes extracted
from the link - that don’t include any personal commentary/opinion/analysis. See Sec.1a
8. Any post by a member that is a copy or share from HCR’s public page. We post them at
times, and most people read them already.</ul>

Having outlined what we don’t want, there will be exceptions, and occasions when we approve a
post that might fall outside of a strict interpretation of the rules.
c) Exceptions: An opinion that is particularly well-written, an attachment to a link that is
unique or worth reading, or a post we believe may stimulate interesting discussions in the
comments. These are posts that also may invite emotion and anger, but are worth our time to
moderate more heavily.
d) HCR’s Name: Please remember that we are curators, in a sense, and keepers of a space
that has Dr. Richardson’s name in it. We feel that we have assumed a responsibility to prevent
anything from appearing in this group that could be easily taken out of context and used against
her. We take that responsibility very seriously, and it is at the top of our minds for every decision
we make. Although rare, some posts may simply be declined thus.
e) Occasionally we’re questioned about free speech or academic freedom, usually when
we’ve declined a post.
First, we are not the government. You are entitled to protection under the law if you believe the
government has censored your speech. We’re just a private Facebook group with a special
3
4
interest. We’re not attempting to censor anyone’s ideas or opinions. It’s as simple as this: not all
opinions or ideas are relevant or meet the standard we wish to uphold.
Secondly, we’re also not an academic group. We aren’t going to judge you or give you a failing
grade because you cited Wikipedia as a source. We do value the spirit of inquiry and discussion
that’s a part of academic freedom, but even within the context of the academy decisions are
made about what to publish. One journal rejects an article, but another accepts it. It’s a fact of
life. If we’ve declined your post, you have other options. You can post it on your own Facebook
page. You can start a blog. You can publish it on sites like Medium, which have thousands of
readers.
Finally, we aren’t experts! We will make mistakes. There are only a few of us reading through
the posts, and we get tired or distracted or make a bad judgment call. It happens. Feel free to
call us out if you strongly believe that we’ve made a mistake. Make your case. We have
corrected mistakes before.
</ol>
**********************
Our intention is not to create hurdles for hurdles’ sake. On the contrary, this is an all-out effort to
maintain a space that will adhere to a principle of “quality over quantity” of posts, that we believe
is a breath of fresh air to the folks who appreciate the content that Prof Richardson offers.
We hope you will enjoy learning and engaging your intellect. It’s harder and harder to find those
spaces these days, especially on social media.

SECTION TWO (Sec 2): Other “Declined” Posts
There are situations in which the official listed “RULES” of the group (found in “About” tab), or
section 2 above are not sufficient to explain a notification that your post was declined.
Sometimes, in fact, it’s not technically declined… hopefully:)
Accordingly, please refer to the following:
a) Please make these edits and resubmit for posting
1. Link is great. We need more though. Edit your comments to give more context and
relevance to HCR/History/Politics
2. Tell us more about the actual content in the link and why it matters/how it’s related.
3. This would be much better if you would Include your personal analysis of the
situation/news item you’re sharing (and it’s okay if you find out you’re not entirely
correct:)
4. Do you have any sources/citations? If so include them (and/or relevant links), and if not,
please include the statement that you do not.
5. Can you find a historical angle to make this more relevant?
6. Please also see Sec 1b6 : do you think you can edit this to make it less inflammatory or
less likely to invite a lot of outrage, rants, or emotional responses in comments?
7. Please edit your post to correct the obvious spelling and grammatical errors.
8. Please edit to insert “shift + enter” breaks every few lines as it’s straining for most people
to read one big chunk of text on a device. Sorry..
9. Please edit to have only the original source link.
10. We agree, but can you create something out of this that is more than a fervent wish?

11. Please attach the web link to the item/article you reference, and resubmit.
b) Please use this post elsewhere in the group as follows:
1. We’re creating a specific topic-based thread for members to engage under, and your
post topic/issue will be perfect for you to add there real soon. Save and stay tuned!
2. We have a weekly topic-based thread for your post, which fits as a comment under that.
Please use the search bar to find the thread using the designated hashtag. If you need
information about weekly topic threads, go to the “ABOUT” or “FILES” tabs of the group
and look for “Weekly Topic Threads”.
3. Your question is so great that it will be addressed in an admin created post, and you will
be tagged in it. We’d like feedback from other members as well.
4. Your question/request for feedback will be added to a weekly “member questions” thread
and you will be tagged. Stay tuned!
c) Posts that will not accepted
1. Great commentary but this link was posted too recently, so please search for relevant
keywords and enter your perspective on that post as a comment.
2. This was posted too recently. You may find it if you scroll or simply search for keywords.
3. Welcome! We really do appreciate your hi/thanks/intro very much. We have a weekly
‘welcome’ thread for new members like you to say hello. Stay tuned! We just simply
cannot fill the feed with these.
4. Hi! We appreciate your sentiments for Prof. Richardson, but she doesn’t ‘live’ here and
we have no way of relaying the message. Please go to her public page.
5. Hi! We love poems, music, hopeful messages and memes too, but this group limits our
7

content to politics and history as discussed by HCR. You may post these types of things
as comments.
6. Please look for the “popular topics” section of the group or use the search function to
find relevant keywords for your question/comment. This has been discussed, and you
can tag someone from the thread if necessary.
7. Hi! We ask that you please use the internet to search the answer/how-to of your
question.
8. Hi there! Please reach out via messenger to one of the admins as your issue requires a
longer and personalized response.
9. This link is old news. Unless you can attach updates/personal analysis of why it’s
relevant now and make it original per Sec.1a, we cannot accept it.
10. Your link says “CONTENT NOT AVAILABLE”. Please make sure this isn’t an error,
and/or that it isn’t a false news item.

SECTION THREE (Sec 3): Comments
We hope posts will spark good, respectful discussions in the comment threads.
a) What’s a good comment?
1. One that seriously considers what the post offers.
2. One that engages with how an idea is expressed (by OP, commenter, or within link) and
why it might be valid or not.
3. Extensions of the idea(s) to other historical periods or aspects of Dr. Richardson’s works.
4. One that offers additional resources or supporting ‘evidence’
5. One that inquires or seeks more understanding from a member’s comment.
6. One that expresses agreement/support and for which a simple ‘like” or “heart” or “hug”
will not suffice, but rather, has something more to add.
b) What’s NOT good, and/or NOT a discussion?
We don’t like to delete comments. It’s not fun at all, and it’s a lot of work. So help us out, please
While a good comment per above might be the aim, an average, boring, illogical or insubstantial
comment is free to linger forever. But any of the following will get your comment
unceremoniously deleted.
1. Heated debates? Sure. Ugly personal attacks on anyone for any reason?
2. Simple rants. Vulgar rants. Deliberately offensive rants/words. “Trump is a piece of sh*t”
doesn’t advance anyone’s knowledge.

10
3. Memes/GIF’s/Emojis and the like that are vulgar, tacky, insulting (to anyone), or could be
offensive. Yes they’re funny, and even clever at times. This isn’t about personal taste, it’s
about whose name is often referenced, and in the title of this group.
4. Unsupported assertions. If you write “You’re wrong!”, support it with either a reasoned
argument and/or good research. If you don’t have time, just come back later when you
do .
5. Conspiracy theories (or links to them).
c) Turning Comments “OFF”
Although we loathe exercising this option, we may disable comments on a post if:
1. The post is ‘old news’, or comments become unproductive or redundant -
1
2. The topic is such that debates become too inflammatory (usually a gentle reminder will
be attempted first). We don’t always want to go one-by-one and delete every borderline
inappropriate comment on such posts because any thoughtful or important responses to
the offending comment will also get deleted. We don’t want to toss the baby out with the
bathwater, so to speak.
3. It is a post intended for submission into the ‘FILES’ tab and on which we don’t want a
string of comments to appear.
4. At times we may turn commenting off on our own ‘admin’ biz related posts to prevent
hundreds of notifications that are going to garner a lot of well meaning comments such
as, ‘“thank you”. We field hundreds of notifications as it is, and it’s too difficult to sift
through and respond to these. A simple “like” or “heart” will do.
1 We see redundancy when there are so many comments on a post that members continue commenting similarly to
what others have already expressed - with no awareness of the fact. It’s understandable, and we don’t expect you to
keep track of what’s already been said amidst hundreds of comments. We do it for you, in exchange for your
forgiveness if seeing that comments are turned off on a post frustrates you. And then of course we don’t want ‘old
news’ posts generating a comment from a new member that pops the thread back up to the top of feed.

5. We MAY turn commenting off on a post that either has already, and/or we think may
generate a ton of engagement overnight, or during any hours that there is no admin on
duty. We have taken precautions to prevent this, but it can happen. In such a case, there
will be a notice that will appear as the last comment, which will include information on
when the comments will be turned back on.
We understand that this can be frustrating and we do try to prevent exercising this admin option.
The main reason we keep an eye on the number of comments that are generated on posts,
however, is because we want to ensure that fresher posts are not prevented from appearing at
the top of the newsfeed, for the sake of a few posts that might be merely be full of redundancies
or uninformative comments.
