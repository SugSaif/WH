                The American paradox series continues with a further account of the late nineteenth century. In this
                period, Americans are concerned about 'communism' and see the myth of the American cowboy as a foil,
                with its image of the heroic white man bringing civilization to savages, and building communities in the
                wilderness. Heather discusses the forces that drove American politics in this era, in particular as
                political alliances in the North and the East solidified, the West became a fertile ground to grow
                voting coalitions. It became mutually beneficial for elites in established regions of the country to
                form alliances with their counterparts in the West, and the losers in this narrative were Mexican,
                Chinese, African and Native Americans.

                        site: The results of the U.S. presidential election of 1876 were a mess. A Democratic candidate
                        had emerged with the lead in the popular vote, but 19 electoral votes from four states were in
                        dispute. In 1877, Congress convened to settle the election—and their solution proved to be the
                        beginning of the end for Reconstruction in the south.</blockquote><br>

                        Wyoming—the largest admission of states since the original 13. This addition of 12 new senators
                        and 18 new electors to the Electoral College was a deliberate strategy of late-19th-century
                        Republicans to stay in power after their swing toward Big Business cost them a popular majority.
                        The strategy paid dividends deep into the future</blockquote><br>

                        marked the political landscape of the last quarter of the nineteenth century. At no other time
                        was the citizen’s interest in elections and politics more avid than during this time period. In
                        fact, 80 to 90 percent of the eligible voters (white and black males in the North and white
                        males the South) consistently voted in local and national elections. This amazing turnout
                        occurred at a time when the major political parties differed little on the issues and when the
                        platforms of the two main national political parties were almost indistinguishable.
                        Consequently, throughout the era, voters gave few strict mandates to either parties or
                        individuals and the outcomes of the presidential races were determined by a relatively small
                        number of votes.</blockquote><br>

                        characterized politics in the American West, particularly labor politics, in the late-19th
                        century. Labor leaders like Denis Kearney and H. L. Knight of California’s Workingmen’s Party
                        often resorted to popular racist arguments to justify the exclusion of Chinese immigrants. In
                        this 1878 address, Kearney and Knight described the Chinese as a race of “cheap working slaves”
                        who undercut American living standards and thus should be banished from America’s shores. While
                        rare, some in the labor movement challenged the racist appeals of leaders like Kearney and

                        under three presidents. He lost the 1884 election by 1,047 votes in New York State in what has

                        created prosperity and new lifestyles for some, but these changes also had a widespread negative
                        impact in areas dominated by farming...During the late 1880s, a series of droughts devastated
                        the West. To make matters worse, the McKinley Tariff of 1890 was one of the highest the country
                        had ever seen. This was detrimental to American farmers, as it drove up the prices of farm
                        equipment. By 1890, the level of agrarian distress was at an all-time high...The Populist Party
                        emerged out of the Farmers’ Alliances and the agricultural distress of the 1880s.</blockquote>

                        to horseback and continued north toward Buffalo, Wyoming, the Johnson County seat. Their mission

                        invading force. The invaders (as they came to be known) included some of the most powerful
                        cattlemen in Wyoming, their top employees and 23 hired guns. The invasion resulted from
                        long‑standing disputes between these cattle barons, who owned herds numbering in the thousands,
                        and small operators, most running just enough cattle to support their families.</blockquote><br>

                        historical moment. In 1898, the United States won the Spanish-American War and, by treaty,
                        acquired the territories of Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Previous U.S. territorial
                        acquisitions — for example, the Louisiana Purchase from France and the acquisition of Florida
                        from Spain — obligated the federal government to admit these localities to the Union and extend
                        constitutional rights to them. For example, the United States’ treaty for the purchase of the
                        Louisiana territory provided the following: “The inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be
                        incorporated into the Union of the United States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to
                        the principles of the Federal Constitution, to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages and
                        immunities of citizens of the United States . . . .” Id. (quoting Treaty Between the United
                        States of America and the French Republic, Fr.-U.S., Apr. 30, 1803, art. III, 8 Stat. 200, 202).

                         <div class="desc">[From wikipedia] Richardson’s first book, The Greatest Nation of the Earth (1997), stemmed
                             from her dissertation at Harvard University. Inspired by Eric Foner’s work on pre-Civil War
                             Republican ideology, Richardson analyzed Republican economic policies during the war. She
                             contended that their efforts to create an activist Federal Government during the Civil War
                             marked a continuation of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as war bonds
                             and greenbacks or the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act, revolutionized the role
                             of the Federal Government in the U.S. economy. At the same time, these actions laid the
                             groundwork for the Republican Party’s shift to Big Business after the Civil War.</div>

                <div class="desc">In this 2001 book, Richardson "focused on the “Northern abandonment of Reconstruction.” Building
                    on the earlier work of C. Vann Woodward, she argued that a more complete understanding of the period
                    required appreciation of class, not only race. As Reconstruction continued into the 1870s and
                    especially the 1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South more from a class
                    perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their earlier humanitarianism. In
                    the midst of the labor struggles of the Gilded Age, Republicans came to compare “the demands of the
                    ex-slaves for land, social services, and civil rights” to the demands of white laborers in the
                    North. This ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of Reconstruction, as they chose
                    the protection of their economic and business interests over their desire for racial equality."

                    impacted all Americans, not just those in the South. She incorporated the West into the
                    discussion of Reconstruction as no predecessor had. Between 1865 and 1900, Americans re-imagined the
                    role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its citizens. However,
                    racism, sexism, and greed divided Americans, and the same people who increasingly benefited from
                    government intervention—white, middle-class Americans—actively excluded African-Americans, Native
                    Americans, immigrants, and organized laborers from the newfound bounties of their reconstructed

                            slaughter of Native Americans in South Dakota in 1890. She argued that party politics
                            and opportunism led to Wounded Knee. After a bruising midterm election, President Benjamin
                            Harrison needed to shore up his support. To do so, he turned to The Dakotas, where he
                            replaced seasoned Indian agents with unqualified political allies, who incorrectly assumed
                            that the Ghost Dance Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one third of its
                            force in order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event, Republicans tried to
                            paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats." [wikipedia] </div>

                        <div class="desc">In this 2014 book, Richardson "extended her study of the Republican
                            Party into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This book studied the entire life
                            of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of George W. Bush.
                            The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” a small group of wealthy white men
                            who controlled all three branches of government. These Republicans articulated a new vision
                            of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War, Republicans
                            began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers and
                            industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar process took
                            place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle successful New Deal policies
                            and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were able to
                            return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first Theodore Roosevelt
                            during the Progressive Era, and then Dwight D. Eisenhower, who enforced integration and
                            maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another
                            fall from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that Republicans
                            treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise from humble
                            beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the original
                            Republicans." [wikipedia]</div>

                             <div class="desc">In her most recent publication, Richardson argues "that America was founded with
                                 contradicting ideals, with the ideas of liberty, equality, and opportunity on one hand,
                                 and slavery and hierarchy on the other. United States victory in the American Civil War
                                 should have settled that tension forever, but at the same time that the Civil War was
                                 fought, Americans also started moving into the West. In the West, Americans found and
                                 expanded upon deep racial hierarchies, meaning that hierarchical values survived in
                                 American politics and culture despite the crushing defeat of the pro-slavery
                                 Confederacy. Those traditions--a rejection of democracy, an embrace of entrenched
                                 wealth, the marginalization of women and people of color--have found a home in modern
                                 conservative politics, leaving the tremendous promise of America unfulfilled." [wikipedia]</div>
