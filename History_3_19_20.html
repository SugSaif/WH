            <p>


                In this video, Heather introduces herself and her background in the discipline of American Studies, why history (which she briefly defines as ‘how and why societies change’) matters, and how she
                is motivated to study the difference between reality and its image, particularly when the latter seems
                to be more
                impactful than the former. For her, ideas are the most important contributors to change in society. She
                feels her background allows her to pick from daily news those events that are new, unusual or
                significant, and to describe them in a broader context. <br><br>

                She answered several questions: 1) how does the situation now compare with the 1918 Spanish flu; 2) Can
                Trump delay the November 2020 election; 3) What is the history of fake news in the US; 4) What are her
                favorite books to read at the moment, and 5) Why do people move towards political fringes.

                    journalism has been
                    defined as any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical manner. The term was
                    coined in the
                    1890s to describe the ferocious circulation war between William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal
                    and the New York
                    World, owned by Joseph Pulitzer. They sought out crime, scandal and salacious detail. Facts that got
                    in the way of a
                    gripping story could be left out. Imaginary details could be added. Any excuse to include an image
                    of a
                    scantily-clad woman was welcome. The goal was to create a sensation that would prompt people to buy
                    copies of the
                    paper. In other words, truth was sacrificed, a victim to profit. </blockquote><br>

                    which still appears on the masthead of the newspaper today. He wrote the slogan as a declaration of

                    its 1929 Great
                    Lakes Broadcasting Co. decision, the FRC asserted that the “public interest requires ample play for
                    the free and
                    fair competition of opposing views, and the Commission believes that the principle applies to all

                    then-Vice President Richard Nixon to transfer power if Eisenhower became incapacitated. Eisenhower
                    also had his

                    gained additional urgency. Congress approved the 25th Amendment in 1965, and state ratification was

                    controversy. With
                    the conflict between liberal and red-hunter still raging, William Buckley and L. Brent Bozell have
                    undertaken what
                    they would call an impartial and sober survey of the man and his beliefs. But the authors, because
                    of their
                    preconceptions, soon find themselves battling on the side of the Senator and reading into the record
                    of the last
                    four years the best of all possible meanings. </blockquote><br>

                    influential conservative
                    thinker who died in February at the age of 82, opposed every milestone achieve­ment of the civil
                    rights movement. He
                    denounced the Supreme Court’s 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education when it was handed down,
                    opposed the 1965
                    Voting Rights Act, and belittled the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a marginal federal effort to “instruct
                    small merchants
                    in the Deep South on how they may conduct their business.” </blockquote><br>

                    Decades from
                    now, historians quite likely will reflect back upon the Contract With America as one of the most
                    significant
                    developments in the political history of the United States. As Newt Gingrich, the first Republican
                    Speaker of the
                    House of Representatives in 40 years, has written: "there is no comparable congressional document in
                    our
                    two-hundred-year history." </blockquote><br>

                        target='_blank'> Yes, Polarization Is Asymmetric—and Conservatives Are Worse </a> <br> QUOTE: As
                    the Pew study
                    makes clear, in the mid- to late-1990s, we did not have anywhere near the level of public
                    polarization or
                    ideological or partisan animosity that we have now. In the public, this phenomenon has been much
                    more recent (and is
                    accelerating). But in the Gingrich era in Congress, starting in 1993, where Republicans united in
                    both houses to
                    oppose major Clinton initiatives and moved vigorously from the start of his presidency to
                    delegitimize him, the era
                    of tribalism started much earlier, while the ante was upped dramatically in the Obama years. The
                    fact is that it was
                    not public divisions on issues that drove elite polarization, but the opposite: Cynical politicians
                    and political
                    consultants in the age of the permanent campaign, bolstered by radio talk-show hosts and cable-news
                    producers and
                    amplified by blogs and social media, did a number on the public. </blockquote><br>
