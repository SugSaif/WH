                    target='_blank'>Sons of Wichita: How the Koch Brothers Became America's Most Powerful and Private
                    Dynasty, by Daniel Schulman (2015, Grand Central Publishing) </a> <br> <b>From publisher comments</b>:
                Influenced by the sentiments of their father, who was present at the birth of the John Birch Society,
                Charles and David have spent decades trying to remake the American political landscape and mainline
                their
                libertarian views into the national bloodstream. They now control a machine that is a center of gravity
                within the Republican Party. </li><br>


        <li><a href='https://www.powells.com/book/-9780385535595' target='_blank'>Dark Money: The Hidden History of the
                Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right, by Jane Mayer (2016, BANTAM DOUBLEDAY DELL) </a> <br>
            <b>From publisher comments</b>: When libertarian ideas proved decidedly unpopular with voters, the Koch brothers
            and their allies chose another path. If they pooled their vast resources, they could fund an interlocking
            array of organizations that could work in tandem to influence and ultimately control academic institutions,
            think tanks, the courts, statehouses, Congress, and, they hoped, the presidency. Richard Mellon Scaife, the
            mercurial heir to banking and oil fortunes, had the brilliant insight that most of their political
            activities could be written off as tax-deductible “philanthropy.”</li><br>

                target='_blank'>Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America, By
                Christopher Leonard (2019, Simon & Schuster) </a> <br> <b>From publisher comments</b>: Leonard uses the
            extraordinary account of how the biggest private company in the world grew to be that large to tell the
            story of modern corporate America. The annual revenue of Koch Industries is bigger than that of Goldman
            Sachs, Facebook, and U.S. Steel combined.</li><br>

    <li>The movie <a href=" https://www.thebrainwashingofmydad.com/"><em>The Brainwashing of My Dad</em></a> through
        interviews with "media luminaries, cognitive linguists,
        grassroots activist groups such as: Noam Chomsky, Steve Rendall, Jeff Cohen, Eric Boehlert, George Lakoff, Carol
        Wallin from STOP RUSH, HearYourselfThink, Claire Conner and others, “Brainwashing” unravels the plan to shift
        the country to the Right over the last 30 years, largely through media manipulation. The result has lead to
        fewer voices, less diversity of opinion, massive intentional misinformation and greater division of our country."
