                                HCR was originally planning to conclude her American paradox series today, but stated
                                that she will be breaking this up into two sessions. As it is, what she covered in this
                                session in about 70 minutes might provide enough information for at least 2-3 weeks of a
                                modern American history college course. 
                                <br><br>

                                The paradox (equality for some has mandated inequality for others) to perpetuate itself
                                has always required certain myths and symbols, such as that of the yeoman farmer, the
                                Western cowboy, and the hard-working taxpayer. In the late 20th century, how this idea
                                was carried further and took hold of very large segments of the American population was
                                HCR's major theme in this chat, but as she developed this she tied together (in an
                                extemporaneous video essay) Reaganomics, voodoo economics, the strategy of tax cuts and
                                who benefited from these,
                                the Reagan doctrine, the importance of Norquist and Gingrich, Limbaugh, Ailes and
                                right-wing media,
                                the K-street project, economic inequality, the militia movement, the Overton window,
                                political 'purity' tests, how Clinton scandals were developed, voter suppression,
                                and recent judicial nominees. 
                                <br><br>
                                As such, once again, there are many more links than usual,
                                which provide background for areas she touched.

                                        the Overton Window has always been about strategy. Though Overton himself never
                                        committed his most influential idea to paper, his Mackinac Center colleague Joe
                                        Lehman continued his work after Overton’s death in 2003 at age 43. Lehman not
                                        only coined the term “Overton Window,” he weaponized it, setting up training
                                        sessions on the concept for other right-leaning think tankers. The term filtered
                                        into the conservative blogosphere in 2006, when Josh Trevino enthused about the
                                        window as a tool for the right. “Step by step, ideas that were once radical or
                                        unthinkable—homeschooling, tuition tax credits, and vouchers—have moved into
                                        normal public discourse,” Trevino declared. “The conscious decision to shift the
                                        Overton Window is yielding its results.” The concept did not reach a wider
                                        audience, however, until Glenn Beck cast Overton’s ideas as the bogeyman in his
                                        2010 best-seller, The Overton Window. The villain of Beck’s tale is Arthur
                                        Gardner, an aging PR guru who plots to use the Overton Window to foist his own
                                        objectives (“criminalize dissent,” “reinforce dependence and collectivism”) on
                                        an unsuspecting and gullible public. In his afterword, Beck urges readers to
                                        watch out for manipulation in their own lives and to set their own
                                        priorities.....This is perhaps the Overton Window’s biggest drawback as a theory
                                        of change: It tells us more about the handful of activists who supposedly move
                                        the window than the voters whose opinions actually change...The more divided we
                                        become, the harder it is to locate the Overton Window, let alone move it. There
                                        is now a window of policies that are acceptable to the Republican base, and
                                        another for Democrats, but on the national level, there is no window. Instead of
                                        a consensus edging one way or another, we have a choice between two poles [see

        <div class="desc">[From wikipedia] Richardson’s first book, The Greatest Nation of the
                Earth (1997), stemmed
                from her dissertation at Harvard University. Inspired by Eric Foner’s work on
                pre-Civil War
                Republican ideology, Richardson analyzed Republican economic policies during the
                war. She
                contended that their efforts to create an activist Federal Government during the
                Civil War
                marked a continuation of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as
                war bonds
                and greenbacks or the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act,
                revolutionized the role
                of the Federal Government in the U.S. economy. At the same time, these actions
                laid the
                groundwork for the Republican Party’s shift to Big Business after the Civil War.

        <div class="desc">In this 2001 book, Richardson "focused on the “Northern abandonment of
                Reconstruction.” Building
                on the earlier work of C. Vann Woodward, she argued that a more complete
                understanding of the period
                required appreciation of class, not only race. As Reconstruction continued into
                the 1870s and
                especially the 1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South
                more from a class
                perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their earlier
                humanitarianism. In
                the midst of the labor struggles of the Gilded Age, Republicans came to compare
                “the demands of the
                ex-slaves for land, social services, and civil rights” to the demands of white
                laborers in the
                North. This ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of
                Reconstruction, as they chose
                the protection of their economic and business interests over their desire for
                racial equality."

        <div class="desc">In this 2007 book, "Richardson presented Reconstruction as a national
                event that
                impacted all Americans, not just those in the South. She incorporated the West
                into the
                discussion of Reconstruction as no predecessor had. Between 1865 and 1900,
                Americans re-imagined the
                role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its
                citizens. However,
                racism, sexism, and greed divided Americans, and the same people who
                increasingly benefited from
                government intervention—white, middle-class Americans—actively excluded
                African-Americans, Native
                Americans, immigrants, and organized laborers from the newfound bounties of
                their reconstructed
                nation." [from wikipedia] </div>

        <div class="desc">In this book, published in 2010, Richardson "focused on the U.S.
                Army’s
                slaughter of Native Americans in South Dakota in 1890. She argued that party
                politics
                and opportunism led to Wounded Knee. After a bruising midterm election,
                President Benjamin
                Harrison needed to shore up his support. To do so, he turned to The Dakotas,
                where he
                replaced seasoned Indian agents with unqualified political allies, who
                incorrectly assumed
                that the Ghost Dance Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one
                third of its
                force in order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event,
                Republicans tried to
                paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats."

        <div class="desc">In this 2014 book, Richardson "extended her study of the Republican
                Party into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This book studied the
                entire life
                of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of George W.
                Bush.
                The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” a small group of wealthy
                white men
                who controlled all three branches of government. These Republicans articulated a
                new vision
                of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War,
                Republicans
                began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful
                bankers and
                industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar
                process took
                place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle successful New
                Deal policies
                and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were
                able to
                return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first Theodore
                Roosevelt
                during the Progressive Era, and then Dwight D. Eisenhower, who enforced
                integration and
                maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented
                yet another
                fall from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that
                Republicans
                treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise
                from humble
                beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the
                original
                Republicans." [wikipedia]</div>

        <div class="desc">In her most recent publication, Richardson argues "that America was
                founded with
                contradicting ideals, with the ideas of liberty, equality, and opportunity on
                one hand,
                and slavery and hierarchy on the other. United States victory in the American
                Civil War
                should have settled that tension forever, but at the same time that the Civil
                War was
                fought, Americans also started moving into the West. In the West, Americans
                found and
                expanded upon deep racial hierarchies, meaning that hierarchical values survived
                in
                American politics and culture despite the crushing defeat of the pro-slavery
                Confederacy. Those traditions--a rejection of democracy, an embrace of
                entrenched
                wealth, the marginalization of women and people of color--have found a home in
                modern
                conservative politics, leaving the tremendous promise of America unfulfilled."
