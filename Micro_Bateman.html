      Why is that demagogues rise to power so frequently through democratic means?
<br>
      David Bateman in his recent <a
          href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Disenfranchising_Democracy/6DdqDwAAQBAJ">book</a> and during this
      <a
          href="https://newbooksnetwork.com/david-a-bateman-disenfranchising-democracy-constructing-the-electorate-in-the-us-the-uk-and-france-cambridge-up-2020/">discussion</a>
      provides a potential answer by examining how this occurs in several different Western
      societies over extended periods. Well-positioned people ('elites') often work towards furthering their advantages
      through means and alliances. This often involves two potentially unsavory actions --"othering" of some who are
      comparatively disadvantaged, and at the same time ignoring potential flaws in those who are more advantaged--as
      long as these actions lead to further their relative positions. The 'other' differs in Batemanâ€™s examples from the
      UK, US and France, but the dynamics are similar.
<br><br>
      For Bateman, ultimately this type of process ensured that "democratization in America was premised upon
      disenfranchisement or that racial disenfranchisement was an inevitable consequence of democratization," and this
      particular type of disenfranchisement occurred in the first part of the 19th century.
