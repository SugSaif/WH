        Barry Goldwater, the conservative Republican senator from Arizona, lost the 1964 presidential election to Lyndon

          The New Left</a><br>
        Impressions of America is a podcast that started in 2018, and focuses on deep dives into specific topics in
        recent U.S. history. In this episode, featuring an interview with Douglas Rossinow, the "New Left" (whose focus
        was on narratives and manifestations of white supremacy and American imperialism) is covered. Rossinow has a
        sensibility and knowledge about leftist movements in the US, particularly in the 20th century. The discussion
        gets into the origins of the New Left in the mid-20th century, to its demise by 1972, and its relationships with
        black power movements, with intellectual liberals (such as John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr),
        and with counterculturists (the so-called ‘hippies’ and the ‘merry pranksters’ who often considered the New Left
        ‘politicos’ unauthentic), including periods of conflict and those of rapprochement. Several interesting figures
        come up such as Ken Kesey, Thomas Wolfe, Paul Tillich , and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Rossinow claims that mass
        support for figures such as Reagan and Nixon, while abetted by an antipathy to the New Left, was primarily
        driven by an opposition of significant segments of white society to civil rights legislation and by alienation
        caused by perceived threats from the emerging liberal agenda as exemplified by Johnson’s 'Great Society'. </td>

          target='_blank'> Political Parties - The Reagan Revolution - 6</a><br>
        The year 1968 marked a watershed in American politics. Anti-war protests were roiling the country. Civil rights
        leader Martin Luther King Jr. was shot dead in Memphis. Democratic President Lyndon Johnson’s approval rating
        was plummeting. The assassination of Democratic presidential hopeful Robert Kennedy would throw the party into
        disarray, toppling the New Deal coalition built by Franklin Delano Roosevelt two generations earlier and leading
        to a conservative surge. The political sea change would drive Republican nominee Richard Nixon to the White
        House in 1968. And it would eventually elect a former actor and California governor who would change the face of
        American politics in ways that are still being felt to this day. His name was Ronald Reagan.

        In this episode we chat with Angie Maxwell, co-author of The Long Southern Strategy. We discuss the history of
        the Southern Strategy and dive into the coded language of the Republicans when discussing race, the role of
        Southern white women in the strategy and the large role Christianity plays in shaping the identity of southern
        politics. We also look ahead to 2020 and how the extreme views of Trump's Republican party could help turn Texas
        blue.

        The Panic of 1819: The First Great Depression tells the story of the first nationwide economic collapse to
        strike the United States. Much more than a banking crisis or real estate bubble, the Panic was the culmination
        of an economic wave that rolled through the United States, forming before the War of 1812, cresting with the
        land and cotton boom of 1818, and crashing just as the nation confronted the crisis over slavery in Missouri.

        Donald Trump has clinched the Republican party presidential nomination, and some political pundits wonder if his
        nomination represents a watershed for the GOP. On this episode of BackStory, we unpack the origins, evolution,
        and reinvention of the Grand Old Party. From its birth in 1854 by anti-slavery activists in the North, to the
        party of small government and low taxes, we look at how the Republican party has reinvented itself at various
        points in its history.</td>

        the Prussian Empire and the collapse of the Second Empire. The radical and revolutionary government and its
        brutal suppression was the inspiration for Karl Marx’s “dictatorship of the proletariat.” Although the

        In Saussure’s Linguistics, Structuralism, and Phenomenology: The Course in General Linguistics after a Century
        (Palgrave Macmillan, 2020), Beata Stawarska guides us to consider Ferdinand de Saussure’s Course in General
        Linguistics anew. By delving into Saussure’s autograph notes, letters, and student lecture notes Stawarska
        reframes all of the hierarchical pairs promoted as part of his doctrine—the signifier and the signified, la
        langue and la parole, synchrony and diachrony. The book performs reading and writing without borders that it
        also argues Saussure thought necessary to think about language. Along the way, it questions sedimented ideas
        about structuralism, post-structuralism, phenomenology, and the object of linguistics, which is to say, language

        How should we think about the relationship between subjectivity and experience? In Anaesthetics of Existence:
        Essays on Experience at the Edge (Duke University Press, 2020), Cressida J. Heyes approaches this question
        through interrogating the apparent limits of experience found in unconsciousness—including sleep; forms of
        “checking out”—including general anesthesia and a glass of wine; and childbirth. Using genealogy and critical
        phenomenology grounded in feminist theory, Heyes approaches the project of conceptualizing agency through an
        interrogation of things that affect us, that happen to us, that we fall into, and undergo, but that are at the
        limits of experience and what can be said about it.</td>

        In Ancient Relativity: Plato, Aristotle, Stoics and Skeptics (Oxford University Press, 2020), Matthew Duncombe
        considers ancient views of relativity from Plato, Aristotle, the Skeptics (particularly Simplicius), and the
        Stoics (particularly Sextus Empiricus). Duncombe, an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of
        Nottingham, defends the view that these thinkers shared a common basic position that he calls “constitutive
        relativity” – the idea that relativity is a matter of the relative being a certain way, rather than having a
        certain predicate true of it or having a certain feature. He argues that this reading is in the background in a
        number of arguments in these thinkers, including Parmenides’ main objection to Plato’s Theory of the Forms, and
        that it comes into its own as a key element of the Skeptics’ opposition to dogmatic belief.</td>

        Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the enclosure movement of the 18th and 19th centuries. In the early 19th
        century, the Northamptonshire poet John Clare took a good look at the countryside and didn’t like what he saw.
        He wrote: "Fence meeting fence in owners little boundsOf field and meadow, large as garden-grounds,In little
        parcels little minds to please,With men and flocks imprisoned, ill at ease."Enclosure means literally enclosing
        a field with a fence or a hedge to prevent others using it. This seemingly innocuous act triggered a revolution
        in land holding that dispossessed many, enriched a few but helped make the agricultural and industrial
        revolutions possible. It saw the dominance of private property as the model of ownership, as against the
        collective rights of previous generations.</td>

        Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Social Contract and ask a foundational question of political philosophy – by
        what authority does a government govern? “Man was born free and he is everywhere in chains”. So begins Jean
        Jacques Rousseau’s great work on the Social Contract. Rousseau was trying to understand why a man would give up
        his natural freedoms and bind himself to the rule of a prince or a government. But the idea of the social
        contract - that political authority is held through a contract with those to be ruled - began before Rousseau
        with the work of John Locke, Hugo Grotius and even Plato. We explore how an idea that burgeoned among the 17th
        century upheavals of the English civil war and then withered in the face of modern capitalist society still
        influences our attitude to government today. With Melissa Lane, Senior University Lecturer in History at

        the story of Maria Halpin, the woman who fathered his secret son, and paid dearly for it. Stephanie’s scandal is
        about one of the first government-sanctioned, anti-gay witch-hunts. This tale throws a spotlight on that one
        time when the Navy, in an attempt to rid its ranks of gay servicemen, sanctioned a whole bunch of inexplicable
        gayness. Spoiler alert: things get real REAL entrappy!!</td>

        great federal corruption scandal! We’ve grown a lot since then, haven’t we? Tux revisits our 22nd and 24th
        president “Grover the Good,” (or as he should be known “Grover the Garbage Juice” or “Groper Cleveland”). Last
        episode Tux explored how before Cleveland ran for president he was busy being a womanizing scumbag and alleged
        rapist in upstate New York. This time we learn how he was still a bachelor when he was sworn into the Oval

        It’s been estimated that as many as 27 million Americans can trace their lineage to the Scots people. A 2017
        American Community Survey found 5.4 million respondents claimed Scottish heritage while another 3 million
        specifically identified as Scots Irish, or Scotch Irish – indicating they are descendants of immigrants who
        originated in Scotland, migrated to the north of Ireland, principally Ulster, and then later moved onward to the

        different meanings; 3) Think of the “Founders” as real people rather than mythic historic figures; 4) Remember
        that the “Founders” aren’t the only people who count in the Revolution; 5) Remember the importance of historical
        contingency: that anything could have happened during the Revolution.</td>

        and how she should die.

        The backdrop is the smoke and fires that engulfed Tasmania and then later the rest of the country and our wilful

          coronavirus</a><br>
        A year ago French people looked on with horror as the great Notre-Dame went up in flames. The journalist Agnès
        Poirier tells Andrew Marr that the cathedral with its 800 year history represents the soul of the nation. Even
        before the fire was out President Macron was promising that it would be rebuilt. But in Notre-Dame: The Soul of
        France, Poirier recounts how its current reconstruction has been mired in controversy – political, social,
        artistic and religious. Poirier also looks at how the French government and people have reacted to the
        coronavirus pandemic. In Hungary, Viktor Orban’s government has been voted sweeping new powers to rule by decree
        for an indefinite period, to deal with the coronavirus crisis. The academic Martyn Rady is keeping a keen eye on
        how different countries in Central Europe respond. He argues that the region has been shaped by the formidable
        power and influence of the Habsburg dynasty. In his latest book, The Habsburgs: The Rise and Fall of a World
        Power, Rady shows how from modest origins in the 9th century the family soon gained control of the Holy Roman
        Empire, stretching from Spain to Hungary and beyond. </td>

        The Latin scholar Shadi Bartsch has written a new translation of Virgil’s The Aeneid. She tells Kirsty Wark how
        this timeless epic about the legendary ancestor of a Roman emperor has been constantly invoked and reinterpreted
        over its two thousand year history. She argues that this poem still has much to say to contemporary readers
        about gender, politics, religion, morality, nationalism and love. It was while arguing about the merits of the
        Aeneid’s tragic queen, Dido of Carthage, that the classicist Natalie Haynes decided it was time to rescue the
        women in ancient myths. Centuries of male interpretations, she argues, has led to the demonization and dismissal
        of the likes of Medusa, Phaedra and Medea. In Pandora’s Jar: Women in Greek Myths she goes back to the original
        stories, reinstating the more complex roles given to these women in antiquity. In the 17th-century the Italian
        painter Artemisia Gentileschi drew inspiration from the women in ancient myths, allegories and the Bible, as
        seen in a new exhibition of her work at the National Gallery in London. The curator, Letizia Treves, says that
        Gentileschi challenged conventions and defied expectations, painting subjects that were traditionally the
        preserve of male artists, and transforming the meek into warriors.</td>

        In the first episode of the Medieval Archives podcast we discuss Thomas Becket. We discuss his early life, his
        rise to power as the Lord Chancellor of England and ultimately his role as the Archbishop of Canterbury. We talk
        about his friendship and loyalty to King Henry II and his loyalty to the Church and Pope. We also look at his
        influence after his death.</td>

        The dark night, therefore, is an experience of infused contemplative prayer felt as painful because it is
        purifying; it prepares the person for greater union with God through higher states of infused contemplation. The
        difference between this purifying experience of prayer and the discouraging lies of spiritual desolation is

          Edward D. Melillo</a><br>
        “In November 1944,” Edward D. Melillo writes in his book The Butterfly Effect?, “Decca Records released a single
        featuring Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots. ‘Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall’ skyrocketed to number one on
        the top of the Billboard charts in the United States and inaugurated a long-term collaboration between the
        ‘First Lady of Song’ and the fabled record producer Milt Gabler. A century before this musical milestone, the
        Ottoman sultan Abdülmecid I founded the Hereke Imperial Carpet Manufacture to supply elaborate silk rugs for his
        Dolmabahçe Palace on the Bosphorus. These extravagant carpets, among the finest ever woven, featured between
        three and four thousand knots per square inch. Six decades earlier, on October 19, 1781, Brigadier General
        Charles O’Hara of His Britannic Majesty’s Coldstream Guards donned his distinctive scarlet officer’s coat,
        strode onto the battlefield at Yorktown, Virginia, and surrendered the sword of Lieutenant General Charles
        Cornwallis to Major General Benjamin Lincoln of the American Continental Army. A trio of more incongruous
        events, spanning three centuries, is difficult to imagine, yet these episodes share an astonishing feature. They
        depended on the tremendous productive capacity of domesticated insects.” This week on the podcast, Melillo and
        Lewis H. Lapham discuss events like these across human history, which show how, despite any annoyance we might
        feel at the prospect, the world as we know it would cease to function without insects. Lewis H. Lapham speaks
        with Edward D. Melillo, author of The Butterfly Effect: Insects and the Making of the Modern World. Thanks to

          Healing, and Ethics in Tibetan Buddhism</a><br>
        The 4th Aris Lecture in Tibetan and Himalayan Studies was delivered by Dr Sam van Schaik (British Library) on
        15th November 2018 at Wolfson College, Oxford. The lecture was introduced by Professor Ulrike Roesler. Books of
        spells are a constant but little studied aspect of Tibetan Buddhism. Used by lay people as well as monks and
        nuns, they contain a variety of rituals covering divination, healing and protection, making rain and stopping
        hail, and summoning and exorcising spirits and demons. Some books of spells contain other kinds of spells as
        well, such as to make someone fall in love, or to gain powers of clairvoyance, invisibility, and finding hidden
        treasure. Some, but not all books of spells contain aggressive spells -- what we commonly call 'black magic'.
        This talk looks at the role of books of spells in Tibetan Buddhism, and how the use of magic fits within the
        Buddhist ethical framework.</td>

          Metropolis: How ancient Rome stayed great</a><br>
        Professor Greg Woolf, Director of the Institute of Classical Studies at the University of London, gave this
        year's Ronald Syme Lecture at Wolfson College, Oxford. The lecture was introduced by Professor Philomen Probert.
        Romans told many myths of their civic inclusiveness, myths repeated from Machiavelli to modern times. The growth
        of their capital to a city of nearly a million has been understood as dependent on migrations of different
        kinds. Imperial Rome is often portrayed as a cosmopolitan society in which hundreds of languages, cults and
        styles rubbed shoulders in cheerful chaos, microcosm of empire, orbis in urbe. Greg Woolf, in his Syme lecture,
        asks how much of this we can believe given what we know about the scale and nature of human mobility in the
        classical Mediterranean, and the structure of Roman society. Modern analogies have taken us so far, he will
        argue, but compared to the capitals of modern empires ancient Rome was an Alien Metropolis.</td>

          Spectacular Diplomacy: Nero and the Reception of Tiridates of Armenia on the Bay of Naples</a><br>
        The 2018 Ronald Syme Lecture was delivered by Professor Kathleen Coleman, James Loeb Professor of the Classics
        at Harvard University, on 1st November. The lecture was introduced by Wolfson College President Sir Tim
        Hitchens. After much jockeying between Rome and Parthia for control of Armenia, the Romans agreed to the
        reinstatement of the Parthian prince, Tiridates, on the Armenian throne, on condition that he be crowned at Rome
        by Nero. A surviving fragment of the Roman History of Cassius Dio recounts the remarkable nine-month journey
        undertaken by Tiridates, his wife, and their retinue of thousands overland from Armenia to Italy, and their
        ensuing detour to the Bay of Naples, where they were treated to a spectacular display in the arena at Puteoli.
        This episode tends to be overlooked in favor of the subsequent coronation in Rome. But the more one thinks about
        it, the more intriguing the detour becomes. This paper suggests reasons, diplomatic and otherwise, for the
        apparently illogical choice of route and the reception that was laid on for Tiridates at the end of it.</td>

        The 2019 Ronald Syme lecture was presented by Professor Alan Bowman and introduced by Sir Tim Hitchens.
        Alexandria was for many centuries, the largest and most important city in the eastern Mediterranean. This
        lecture explores how Rome tried to ensure its political stability which was crucial for its military control and
        economic interests in the east. This involved direct and indirect management by the imperial house of its role
        as the conduit through which the wealth of Egypt and the eastern luxury goods reached the Mediterranean and
        Italy. At the same time, the complex social and cultural character of its population changed and developed a
        profile distinct from the earlier period under the Ptolemies, turning it into a 'world-capital' which attracted
        the presence and influence of elites from Rome and the wider empire.</td>

        ‘A text is not a text unless it hides from the first comer, from the first glance, the law of its composition
        and the rules of its game. A text remains, moreover, forever imperceptible’. So wrote the superstar philosopher
        Jacques Derrida. But what does it mean to question and deconstruct everything we think we know? In a new
        biography of Derrida titled An Event, Perhaps, Peter Salmon explores the life and works of one of the most
        enigmatic of thinkers. He questions how far Derrida’s ideas have led to today’s ‘post-truth’ age? Virginia
        Woolf's essay ‘How Should One Read a Book?’ posed the question: ‘‘Where are we to begin? How are we to bring
        order into this multitudinous chaos and so get the deepest and widest pleasure from what we read?’ The English
        professor Alexandra Harris looks at whether Woolf’s answer stands the test of time. Bernhard Schlink’s literary
        career took off in 1995 with the publication of his novel The Reader, which became an international bestseller.
        His latest work, Olga (translated into English by Charlotte Collins), is a story of love set in Germany against
        the backdrop of the traumas of the 20th century. Producer: Katy Hickman</td>

        In the Analects, Confucius is recorded as saying "When a country is well governed, poverty is something to be
        ashamed of. When a country is badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of". It's an interesting
        aphorism to consider in the light of China today, as the government seeks to promote Confucian ethics, while at
        the same time running an economy that's delivered vast wealth to a small political elite.

        our Medieval Queens series that came out earlier this season! We’ll specifically talk about their accusations of
        witchcraft and how being a powerful woman can sometimes be a woman’s greatest weakness.</td>

        At its height, the Aksumite Empire extended across the northern Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands, and even
        included parts of Sudan, Somalia and modern-day Yemen. From the first century BC to the seventh or eighth
        centuries AD it was one of the most important trading hubs in north-east Africa. It was also one of the earliest

        There’s a great deal that we don’t know about the fifteenth-century Flemish composer Alexander Agricola, but we
        do know that Agricola is not the name he was born with. We also know that he composed untexted music with
        thought-provoking titles like, “The blind person cannot judge colors,” and that some of his music sounds like
        written-down improvisation. Curious? This hour, we’ll hear secular song and instrumental music from the wacky
        world of Alexander Agricola. Then, we’ll sample the melodies of one of Agricola’s biggest influences in our
