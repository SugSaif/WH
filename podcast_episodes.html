        Barry Goldwater, the conservative Republican senator from Arizona, lost the 1964 presidential election to Lyndon

          The New Left</a><br>
        Impressions of America is a podcast that started in 2018, and focuses on deep dives into specific topics in
        recent U.S. history. In this episode, featuring an interview with Douglas Rossinow, the "New Left" (whose focus
        was on narratives and manifestations of white supremacy and American imperialism) is covered. Rossinow has a
        sensibility and knowledge about leftist movements in the US, particularly in the 20th century. The discussion
        gets into the origins of the New Left in the mid-20th century, to its demise by 1972, and its relationships with
        black power movements, with intellectual liberals (such as John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr),
        and with counterculturists (the so-called ‘hippies’ and the ‘merry pranksters’ who often considered the New Left
        ‘politicos’ unauthentic), including periods of conflict and those of rapprochement. Several interesting figures
        come up such as Ken Kesey, Thomas Wolfe, Paul Tillich , and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Rossinow claims that mass
        support for figures such as Reagan and Nixon, while abetted by an antipathy to the New Left, was primarily
        driven by an opposition of significant segments of white society to civil rights legislation and by alienation
        caused by perceived threats from the emerging liberal agenda as exemplified by Johnson’s 'Great Society'. </td>
