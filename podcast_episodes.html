Barry Goldwater, the conservative Republican senator from Arizona, lost the 1964 presidential election to Lyndon Johnson in one of great landslides of the 20th Century. At the time many thought Goldwater’s brand of fiery conservatism had been relegated to the dustbin of political history, but instead it became the foundation of the modern Republican Party – the party that won five of the next six presidential elections.</td>

Impressions of America is a podcast that started in 2018, and focuses on deep dives into specific topics in recent U.S. history. In this episode, featuring an interview with Douglas Rossinow, the "New Left" (whose focus was on narratives and manifestations of white supremacy and American imperialism) is covered. Rossinow has a sensibility and knowledge about leftist movements in the US, particularly in the 20th century. The discussion gets into the origins of the New Left in the mid-20th century, to its demise by 1972, and its relationships with black power movements, with intellectual liberals (such as John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr), and with counterculturists (the so-called ‘hippies’ and the ‘merry pranksters’ who often considered the New Left ‘politicos’ unauthentic), including periods of conflict and those of rapprochement. Several interesting figures come up such as Ken Kesey, Thomas Wolfe, Paul Tillich , and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Rossinow claims that mass support for figures such as Reagan and Nixon, while abetted by an antipathy to the New Left, was primarily driven by an opposition of significant segments of white society to civil rights legislation and by alienation caused by perceived threats from the emerging liberal agenda as exemplified by Johnson’s 'Great Society'. </td>
