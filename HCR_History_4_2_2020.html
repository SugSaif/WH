        In this session, Heather discusses the formation of the American identity from
        the founding of the Republic through the Antebellum period, later splitting
        into two different notions, one in the North centered around the independent
        individual working for himself and another in the South, emphasizing a
        privileged and powerful oligarchy, which 'knew better' and would 'take care'
        of those less able or fortunate. In the South the concept of democracy,
        due to the workings of the cotton economy, depended on enslaving other people,
        whereas in the North, the democratic principle was centered on the concept
        of the small farmer. Slavery, critical to the way of life in the South, was anathema
        in the North, because there, among other reasons, it was seen as unfair to those
        who had to toil with their own labor, without the assistance of slaves.

            say rather that this country has attained the consequences of the democratic revolution which we are
            undergoing without having experienced the revolution itself. The emigrants who fixed themselves on the
            shores of America in the beginning of the seventeenth century severed the democratic principle from all the
            principles which repressed it in the old communities of Europe, and transplanted it unalloyed to the New
            World. It has there been allowed to spread in perfect freedom, and to put forth its consequences in the laws

            power while their opponents, the Federalists, all but disappeared from the political landscape. With its
            borders now secure from foreign interference, the United States embarked on an immense westward expansion
            that would carry with it the divisive question of slavery and mark a new era in Native American-U.S.
            relations. Because of westward expansion and economic prosperity, the years immediately following the war

            insatiable and average New Orleans prices for it increasing by 80 percent during the first half of the
            1830s, the forced removal of tens of thousands of Native Americans from millions of acres of prime
            southwestern cotton land dovetailed with federal provisions that set initial prices of public land at just
            $1.25 an acre to create a frenzy of migration, investment, and agricultural production. Already vital to the
            American economy by the start of the 1830s, over the course of the decade cotton crops accelerated national

            Rothman <a href="http://jsr.fsu.edu/new-media/podcast/joshua-rothman.html">talked</a> about his book a few
            years ago,
            describing a type of culture that was quite pervasive in the antebellum South, in which 'investors,
            settlers, slaves,
            brigands, and fortune-hunters converged in what was then America's Southwest …[and]…created a tumultuous
            landscape that
            promised boundless opportunity and spectacular wealth. Predicated on ruthless competition, unsustainable
            debt, brutal
            exploitation, and speculative financial practices that looked a lot like gambling, this landscape also
            produced such
            profound disillusionment and conflict that it contained the seeds of its own potential destruction.'
            Interestingly, this
            culture was characterized by prominent lack of religiosity.
            <br><br>

            As many other authors (e.g. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Snu3reQ.png">Glen Feldman</a>)
            have pointed out, later in the century and in the 20th century and beyond,
            religion became a core feature of Southern culture and politics, so this raises
            a question of when and how the transition occurred.
            Rothman (partially) answered this question in
            <a
              href="https://theageofjacksonpodcast.com/episode-6-eugene-genoveses-roll-jordan-roll-with-joshua-d-rothman-history-of-history-2/">another
              conversation</a>,
            when he discussed Eugene D. Genovese, a now deceased 20th-century historian who is very interesting from a
            historiographic perspective.
            <br><br>
            I first heard of Genovese in an <a
              href="https://newbooksnetwork.com/christopher-tomlins-in-the-matter-of-nat-turner-a-speculative-history-princeton-up-2020/">
              interview</a>
            Chris Tomlinson gave about Ned Turner, in which William Styron’s 1967 novel,
            'The Confessions of Nat Turner' and the ensuing
            <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1968/11/07/an-exchange-on-nat-turner/">controversy</a>
            it generated was discussed.

            Genovese, in his book "Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made" tried to reconcile two poles of
            historiography
            which emerged in the early and mid-20th century (one pole characterized by the tradition started by U. B.
            Phillips,
            which was supportive of the so-called 'lost cause narrative', and the other by Stanley Elkins, who compared
            slavery to
            Nazi concentration camps). For Genovese, religion was pivotal, providing a means for control and a
            paradoxical source of
            spiritual strength, thus making possible a hegemony through <a
              href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100132197">manufactured
              consent</a>.

            Only a <a
              href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-ushistory1os2xmaster/chapter/wealth-and-culture-in-the-south/">very
              small
              percentage</a> of people in the south were 'plantar elites', and to maintain hierarchies, narratives and
            symbols were
            needed.

            <br><br>
            Genovese, according to Rothman, came to be an admirer of the conservative value system of the plantar elite,
            which to
            him represented important aspects of Western civilization (such as its humanistic values, and religious as
            well as
            family traditions), and provided a kind of paternalism (both to slaves as well as to whites in lower parts
            of the
            hierarchical system. An ordered harmonius society was possible when everyone knew his or her place.

            from the New Books series of podcasts, Christopher Tomlins discusses
            Nat Turner, who in 1831 led a band of slaves in Virginia in a rebellion that
            killed fifty-five whites. Tomlins provides a striking account of Turner’s
            intellectual development, religious cosmology, and motivations, and offers an original and incisive analysis
            of the Turner Rebellion itself and its impact on Virginia politics. Tomlins also undertakes a deeply
            critical
            examination of William Styron’s 1967 <a
              href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/meditations-confessions-nat-turner">novel</a>, "The
            Confessions of Nat Turner", which restored Turner

            that
            inspired it, written at the time of the rebellion. Stryon's book was controversial when it came out,
            prompting a <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1968/11/07/an-exchange-on-nat-turner/">debate</a>
            between historians. Styron provided his own <a

            Tomlins takes a 'Benjaminian' view of histriography, i.e. history as a process of creating the past with our

            consciousness, actively imbuing it with meaning, rendering it recognizable, and even allowing it to serve as
            purpose, be

            century, the North and South followed different paths, developing into two distinct and very different

            'In an effort to preserve the balance of power in Congress between slave and free states, the Missouri
            Compromise was passed in 1820 admitting Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state. Furthermore,
            with the exception of Missouri, this law prohibited slavery in the Louisiana Territory north of the 36° 30´
            latitude line. In 1854, the Missouri Compromise was repealed by the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Three years later
            the Missouri Compromise was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision, which
            ruled that Congress did not have the authority to prohibit slavery in the territories.</blockquote><br>

            capital where the Mexican government had fled with the advance of U.S. forces. By its terms, Mexico ceded 55
            percent of its territory, including parts of present-day Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado,
            Nevada, and Utah, to the United States. Mexico relinquished all claims to Texas, and recognized the Rio

            </a> <br> 'In the cold morning hours of January 24, 1848, James Marshall, a construction foreman at Sutter’s
            Mill, was inspecting the water flow through the mill’s tailrace. The sawmill, on the banks of the American
            River in Coloma, California, was owned by John A. Sutter, who desperately needed lumber for the building of
            a large flour mill. On that particular morning, Marshall not only found the water to be flowing adequately
            through the mill, but also spied a shiny object twinkling in the frigid stream. Stooping to pick it up, he
            looked with awe at a pea-sized gold nugget lying within his hand.'</blockquote><br>

            created two new territories, and allowed for popular sovereignty. It also produced a violent uprising known
            as 'Bleeding Kansas,' as proslavery and antislavery activists flooded into the territories to sway the vote.
            Political turmoil followed, destroying the remnants of the old Whig coalition and leading to the creation of
            the new Republican Party. Stephen Douglas had touted his bill as a peaceful settlement of national issues,
            but what it produced was a prelude to civil war.'</blockquote><br>

            and abolition in the lead up to the Civil War. This event led to the crisis over the Lecompton Constitution
            as the violence surrounding Kansas put pressure of national politicians to accept a constitution that
            definitively legalized or prohibited slavery in an attempt to stop the bloodshed. Although horrified over
            the violence, Republicans used the events in Kansas to their political advantage to build their base,
            whereas the events only widened the divide between northern and southern Democrats. The political
            ramifications highlight the growing sectional tensions and the violence that ensured.'</blockquote><br>
