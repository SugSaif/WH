                <p><u>Summary</u> : How indigenous history factors into the Civil war and therefore Reconstruction</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 3:48:</u> When people think of the Civil war they often think about where the big
                        battles were, which was the East. In reality, after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the war was
                        in many ways&nbsp; fought over the structure of&nbsp; the West.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 5:53</u>: Americans are trying to impose a structure of law in the Lands west of the
                        Mississippi which previously had a long history of Spanish Colonization. This is happening while
                        the Southwest lands are being integrated into the United States. Incidentally, there is not a
                        lot of settlement in the Northwest portion of the Louisiana purchase, beyond primarily fur
                        trappers.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 9:41</u>: The intention of expanding Slavery into the west is expressed, as at the
                        time&nbsp; property included slaves. This is met with opposition to try to avoid a repeat of the
                        few Elite slave owners reaping the benefits from the many.</p>
                <p><br /> <u>Timestamp 12:34</u>: The United States government worked as quickly as possible to
                        assimilate all the new Western states into the government as possible to avoid the Confederate
                        mindset to spread into the West. The lands that are being integrated are lands that have already
                        been established by indigenous peoples.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 13:09:</u> Many people rush to California in the midst of the gold rush, which leads to
                        the creation of the state at rapid speed. During the creation of this state, laws are created
                        that single out people by race. The people who are singled out include people who already have
                        limited rights, which includes Chinese, Mexicans, and Native Americans.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 16:27:</u> The West becomes a dream of sorts and is envisioned as a pinnacle to
                        contribute to the American economy while still having a quality of life with contributions to
                        family.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 19:47</u>: A Lieutenant Basco chooses to befriend&nbsp; the Apache to
                        &ldquo;capture&rdquo; them. This sparks the Apache war,&nbsp; which is when the Apache partner
                        with a Native American from another Tribe named Geranimo.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 24:27</u> The Erie canal opens in 1825, Which causes the population of the Northwest to
                        explode as the preferred mode of transportation at the time was by water.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 27:30</u>: The Dakota tribe is forced by the United States government to forfeit large
                        amounts of their native lands to only be given a sliver of land with access to food and
                        supplies. The United States government doesn't hold up their end of the bargain as they are in
                        the middle of the Civil war, which causes the Dakota&rsquo;s to disregard their deal made with
                        the Government so they can have food back. This leads to many people who had settled the Dakota
                        lands to be slaughtered. The indigenous people are held to Trial for their actions by the US
                        government, which was a mockery of the Justice system as the&nbsp; trials lasted mere minutes
                        and the names were wrong. Many Dakota&rsquo;s were executed on the grounds of going against the
                        United States government.</p>
                <p><br /> <u>Timestamp 37:56</u>: By 1862 the Indigenous people are viewed as Savage enough to be
                        treated differently. This leads to the largest mass execution in American history. IN effort to
                        get into the West the Confederates and Union both&nbsp; launched a campaign to get into the
                        Southwest so they would get access to ports and California. The Apache and Navajo during the
                        &ldquo;settling&rdquo; take advantage by raiding the lands of the Settlers. This presents the
                        need for Fort Summner to be created, as well as a nearby Native American Reservation. He claims
                        he will stop the Apache wars, and did that by killing all of the Apache he could find.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 45:31</u>: After it becomes acceptable by the US government to Slaughter the Indigenous
                        people who were against the United States Government,&nbsp; Navajo are dehumanized by being
                        marched to the equivalent of an internment camp under the guise of being Hostile Enemies of the
                        Government.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 50:50:</u> The end of the Civil war marks the end of the war between the United States
                        Government and the Confederacy, Not the end of the war between the United States government and
                        the indigenous people.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 56:43</u>: In an effort to accommodate the Union Pacific railroad, the United States
                        Government gives a similar thing that they did with the Dakota&rsquo;s by offering them food,
                        decreased land, and annuities. They do this by creating Reservations primarily in South Dakota
                        and Oklahoma, which frees up the states in between for the Union Pacific Railroad.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><u>Timestamp 59:24:</u>Indians don&rsquo;t have a civil identity at this time, even after the 14th
                        Amendment, which leads to them having no voice or representation to advocate for them. This
                        leads to the 14th amendment in the East making people equal and allowing people to more
                        inclusively participate in government, whereas in the West&nbsp; it's dividing people.</p>

                                <div class="desc">[From wikipedia] Richardson’s first book, The Greatest Nation of the
                                        Earth (1997), stemmed from her dissertation at Harvard University. Inspired by
                                        Eric Foner’s work on pre-Civil War Republican ideology, Richardson analyzed
                                        Republican economic policies during the war. She contended that their efforts to
                                        create an activist Federal Government during the Civil War marked a continuation
                                        of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as war bonds and
                                        greenbacks or the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act, revolutionized
                                        the role of the Federal Government in the U.S. economy. At the same time, these
                                        actions laid the groundwork for the Republican Party’s shift to Big Business
                                        after the Civil War.</div>

                                <div class="desc">In this 2001 book, Richardson "focused on the “Northern abandonment of
                                        Reconstruction.” Building on the earlier work of C. Vann Woodward, she argued
                                        that a more complete understanding of the period required appreciation of class,
                                        not only race. As Reconstruction continued into the 1870s and especially the
                                        1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South more from a
                                        class perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their
                                        earlier humanitarianism. In the midst of the labor struggles of the Gilded Age,
                                        Republicans came to compare “the demands of the ex-slaves for land, social
                                        services, and civil rights” to the demands of white laborers in the North. This
                                        ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of Reconstruction, as
                                        they chose the protection of their economic and business interests over their
                                        desire for racial equality." [From wikipedia] </div>

                                <div class="desc">In this 2007 book, "Richardson presented Reconstruction as a national
                                        event that impacted all Americans, not just those in the South. She incorporated
                                        the West into the discussion of Reconstruction as no predecessor had. Between
                                        1865 and 1900, Americans re-imagined the role of the federal government, calling
                                        upon it to promote the well-being of its citizens. However, racism, sexism, and
                                        greed divided Americans, and the same people who increasingly benefited from
                                        government intervention—white, middle-class Americans—actively excluded
                                        African-Americans, Native Americans, immigrants, and organized laborers from the
                                        newfound bounties of their reconstructed nation." [from wikipedia] </div>

                                <div class="desc">In this book, published in 2010, Richardson "focused on the U.S.
                                        Army’s slaughter of Native Americans in South Dakota in 1890. She argued that
                                        party politics and opportunism led to Wounded Knee. After a bruising midterm
                                        election, President Benjamin Harrison needed to shore up his support. To do so,
                                        he turned to The Dakotas, where he replaced seasoned Indian agents with
                                        unqualified political allies, who incorrectly assumed that the Ghost Dance
                                        Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one third of its force in
                                        order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event, Republicans tried
                                        to paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats."

                                <div class="desc">In this 2014 book, Richardson "extended her study of the Republican
                                        Party into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This book studied the
                                        entire life of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency
                                        of George W. Bush. The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” a
                                        small group of wealthy white men who controlled all three branches of
                                        government. These Republicans articulated a new vision of an America in which
                                        all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War, Republicans began to
                                        emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers
                                        and industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar
                                        process took place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle
                                        successful New Deal policies and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases,
                                        reformers within the party were able to return the GOP to its founding vision of
                                        equality of opportunity, first Theodore Roosevelt during the Progressive Era,
                                        and then Dwight D. Eisenhower, who enforced integration and maintained the New
                                        Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another fall
                                        from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that
                                        Republicans treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as
                                        Obama's rise from humble beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied
                                        the vision of the original Republicans." [wikipedia]</div>

                                <div class="desc">In her most recent publication, Richardson argues "that America was
                                        founded with contradicting ideals, with the ideas of liberty, equality, and
                                        opportunity on one hand, and slavery and hierarchy on the other. United States
                                        victory in the American Civil War should have settled that tension forever, but
                                        at the same time that the Civil War was fought, Americans also started moving
                                        into the West. In the West, Americans found and expanded upon deep racial
                                        hierarchies, meaning that hierarchical values survived in American politics and
                                        culture despite the crushing defeat of the pro-slavery Confederacy. Those
                                        traditions--a rejection of democracy, an embrace of entrenched wealth, the
                                        marginalization of women and people of color--have found a home in modern
                                        conservative politics, leaving the tremendous promise of America unfulfilled."
