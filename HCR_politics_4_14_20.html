In today’s session, Heather answered questions: 1) What is going on with Trump’s hostility towards the post office, 2)
What is the history of 3rd party voting in the United States, 3) Can Trump force the states to ‘open their economies
back up’ using the commerce clause, 4) what are the trade-offs between freedoms and safety in the time of Coronavirus,
and 5) How does the economic situation of the late 1920’s and early 1930’s differ from now? <br><br>

She gave a brief history of the post office and its importance. She gave examples of third parties in the US from the
19th century. She didn’t feel Trump could force states to open up their economies using the commerce clause. She
recognized the issues related to the liberty/safety trade-off, but she posited a thesis that unchecked liberty may
promote oligarchy (this is related to the thesis she is developing in her History chat series on the American paradox).
On the issue of the 1920s/30s versus now, she felt we have more economic tools than they had then. We should be able to
overcome this challenge, and it may, because of the radical exposure it has given to weaknesses and inequities of our
current system, provide an opportunity for positive change, with a possible return to something like the liberal
consensus of the mid 20th century (promoting social welfare, infrastructure, and sensible regulation). </p>

                            Bailout, Explained </a> <br> QUOTE: The Postal Service has been organized in several
                        different ways across American history, but its modern paradigm, dating from the 1970s, dictates
                        that the USPS is supposed to be a self-funded, independently operating public sector entity. And
                        at the core of that entity is a two-sided bargain. On the one hand, the Postal Service gets a
                        monopoly on the provision of daily mail services. On the other hand, the Postal Service
                        undertakes a series of public service obligations that a private company would not provide —
                        most notably, daily mail delivery and flat postage rates regardless of where you live. But the
                        volume of first-class mail — the source of the lion’s share of USPS revenue and the cornerstone
                        of both its monopoly and its universal service obligations — peaked in 2001 at 104 billion
                        pieces of mail. Decline has been fairly steady since then, falling to just 55 billion pieces in
                        2019. The cost of meeting USPS’s basic service obligations, by contrast, has essentially
                        remained steady, creating an obvious financial problem. </blockquote><br>

                        </a> <br> QUOTE: Going postal is an American English slang term, used as a verb meaning to
                        suddenly become extremely and uncontrollably angry, often to the point of violence and in a
                        workplace environment. The term derives from a series of incidents from 1983 onward in which
                        United States Postal Service (USPS) workers shot and killed managers, fellow workers, and
                        members of the police or general public. Between 1986 and 1997, more than 40 people were killed
                        in at least 20 incidents of workplace rage. Following this series of events, the idiom entered
                        common parlance and has been applied to murders committed by employees in acts of workplace
                        rage, irrespective of the employer</blockquote><br>

                        until 2006, the USPS funded those obligations on a pay-as-you-go-basis, pulling out of its
                        pension fund and adding to it as retirees' costs came in. But the PAEA required the Postal
                        Service to calculate all of its likely pension costs over the next 75 years, and then sock away
                        enough money between 2007 and 2016 to cover most of them. </blockquote><br>

                        personal attacks that often overshadowed the issues at stake. And it ended with popular vote
                        totals so close that supporters of an ideologically purist third party effectively handed the
                        presidency to a man whose policies were at explicit and direct cross-purposes with their goals.

                        States, agrarian reformers in southern and midwestern states collaboratively organized for
                        government action against business monopolies, exorbitant railroad rates, secret ballots and

                        joined the “people’s party” or Populist party as a third- party alternative. Emerging from
                        earlier political efforts of farmers, such as the Granger movement and the Farmer’s Alliance,
                        the Populists attracted not only rural white male farmers, but also African American farmers and
                        women reformers. This primary source set highlights prominent Populists, propaganda from
                        political campaigns, and political arguments of the movement. After reading and viewing these

                            Populism and Political Realignment </a> <br> During the 1870s and 1880s the American
                        agricultural community suffered from innumerable problems as the United States became
                        increasingly urban and industrial. Farmers first sought to solve their own problems through the
                        economic cooperatives founded by the Grange. When these self-help programs proved a failure,
                        farmers began to demand that government respond to their plight. They increasingly turned to the
                        Farmers Alliance, a new agrarian group which sought to pressure the major political parties and
                        the Congress into adopting their demands. When, because of the nature of the Gilded Age party
                        system, the Republicans and Democrats as well as Congress refused to respond or responded
                        superficially, the Farmers Alliance evolved into a third political party known as the Populists.
                        They were intent on wresting power from the Republicans and Democrats at both the state and
                        federal level. While they failed to take over the national government through the electoral
                        process, they would end the Gilded Age party system and prepare America for fundamental changes
                        in government accomplished by others after the turn of the century. </blockquote><br>

                        “believed that a balanced budget was important to instill confidence in consumers, business, and
                        the markets, which would thus encourage investment and economic expansion.” But as the severity
                        of the Great Depression became clear, he recognized that emergency relief programs were a
                        necessity no matter the cost. Speaking at a campaign rally in 1936, he declared that “to balance
                        our budget in 1933 or 1934 or 1935 would have been a crime against the American people… When
                        Americans suffered, we refused to pass by on the other side. Humanity came first.” As the
                        economy began to improve, he eventually gave in to conventional wisdom and tried to cut back on
                        spending, triggering the so-called Roosevelt Recession of 1937. </blockquote><br>

                        ended in the 1970s. Wages stagnated, inflation raged, and by the decade's end, income inequality
                        had started to rise. Income inequality grew through the 1980s, slackened briefly at the end of
                        the 1990s, and then resumed with a vengeance in the aughts. In his 2007 book The Conscience of a
                        Liberal, the Nobel laureate, Princeton economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman
                        labeled the post-1979 epoch the "Great Divergence."  It's generally understood that we live in a
                        time of growing income inequality, but "the ordinary person is not really aware of how big it
                        is," Krugman told me. During the late 1980s and the late 1990s, the United States experienced
                        two unprecedentedly long periods of sustained economic growth—the "seven fat years" and the "
                        long boom." Yet from 1980 to 2005, more than 80 percentof total increase in Americans' income
                        went to the top 1 percent. </blockquote><br>

                         <div class="desc">[From wikipedia] Richardson’s first book, The Greatest Nation of the Earth (1997), stemmed
                             from her dissertation at Harvard University. Inspired by Eric Foner’s work on pre-Civil War
                             Republican ideology, Richardson analyzed Republican economic policies during the war. She
                             contended that their efforts to create an activist Federal Government during the Civil War
                             marked a continuation of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as war bonds
                             and greenbacks or the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act, revolutionized the role
                             of the Federal Government in the U.S. economy. At the same time, these actions laid the
                             groundwork for the Republican Party’s shift to Big Business after the Civil War.</div>

                <div class="desc">In this 2001 book, Richardson "focused on the “Northern abandonment of Reconstruction.” Building
                    on the earlier work of C. Vann Woodward, she argued that a more complete understanding of the period
                    required appreciation of class, not only race. As Reconstruction continued into the 1870s and
                    especially the 1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South more from a class
                    perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their earlier humanitarianism. In
                    the midst of the labor struggles of the Gilded Age, Republicans came to compare “the demands of the
                    ex-slaves for land, social services, and civil rights” to the demands of white laborers in the
                    North. This ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of Reconstruction, as they chose
                    the protection of their economic and business interests over their desire for racial equality."

                    discussion of Reconstruction as no predecessor had. Between 1865 and 1900, Americans re-imagined the
                    role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its citizens. However,
                    racism, sexism, and greed divided Americans, and the same people who increasingly benefited from
                    government intervention—white, middle-class Americans—actively excluded African-Americans, Native
                    Americans, immigrants, and organized laborers from the newfound bounties of their reconstructed

                            and opportunism led to Wounded Knee. After a bruising midterm election, President Benjamin
                            Harrison needed to shore up his support. To do so, he turned to The Dakotas, where he
                            replaced seasoned Indian agents with unqualified political allies, who incorrectly assumed
                            that the Ghost Dance Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one third of its
                            force in order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event, Republicans tried to
                            paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats." [wikipedia] </div>

                        <div class="desc">In this 2014 book, Richardson "extended her study of the Republican
                            Party into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This book studied the entire life
                            of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of George W. Bush.
                            The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” a small group of wealthy white men
                            who controlled all three branches of government. These Republicans articulated a new vision
                            of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War, Republicans
                            began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers and
                            industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar process took
                            place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle successful New Deal policies
                            and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were able to
                            return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first Theodore Roosevelt
                            during the Progressive Era, and then Dwight D. Eisenhower, who enforced integration and
                            maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another
                            fall from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that Republicans
                            treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise from humble
                            beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the original
                            Republicans." [wikipedia]</div>

                             <div class="desc">In her most recent publication, Richardson argues "that America was founded with
                                 contradicting ideals, with the ideas of liberty, equality, and opportunity on one hand,
                                 and slavery and hierarchy on the other. United States victory in the American Civil War
                                 should have settled that tension forever, but at the same time that the Civil War was
                                 fought, Americans also started moving into the West. In the West, Americans found and
                                 expanded upon deep racial hierarchies, meaning that hierarchical values survived in
                                 American politics and culture despite the crushing defeat of the pro-slavery
                                 Confederacy. Those traditions--a rejection of democracy, an embrace of entrenched
                                 wealth, the marginalization of women and people of color--have found a home in modern
                                 conservative politics, leaving the tremendous promise of America unfulfilled." [wikipedia]</div>
