<p><u>Summary</u>: The mechanics of democracy, including overview of summary of Civil service laws throughout the years, triggered by Donald Trump protecting various people in his office from being fired by political association</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 2:20:</u> After the assasination of James Garfield by a mentally ill civil servant, Civil servant laws are created to appoint non partisan Civil servants.&nbsp; This allows the government to not be reliant upon one man (the President) but rather the bureaucracy. Although this can be overturned if the President makes an executive order, Trump isn&rsquo;t the first President to use an Executive order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 8:04:</u> The United States is facing an issue regarding the preservation of their Democratic system. Generally speaking, in the United States, the fight for Democracy is done peacefully. There are concerns regarding concerns that the few are representing the many, which resonates with things put in place by the Framers of the Constitution. These things include the Electoral College, rights to Vote, the Supreme Court, and the Senate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 12:59</u>: The electoral college was originally put into place to bypass the idea that individual voters would choose the best candidate for the presidency. This was done in a time where newspapers were few and far between, and internet and television were nonexistent. This paired with minimal travel outside of the person's home state created a need for educated, informed citizens to gather and discuss the more logical choice for President. These people couldn&rsquo;t hold office as this would create a conflict of interest. Previously this was done by individual districts, but after the first election moved to a winner take all system, which was the root of the reason that a President can be elected without the popular vote, and therefore doesn&rsquo;t represent the populus that they govern. In the way it is currently run, it protects the minority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 21:32:</u> In the event a candidate cannot win the Electoral college, they attempt to get as many votes as they can. This leads to the opening up of the vote, which in turn changes the nomination process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 27:44:</u> The shortly lived Whig party proposes things to be supported by the government, such as River and Harbor maintenance as well as infrastructure. The Southern slave owners object stating that the constitution should be limited to exactly what was written by the framers. They adamantly oppose any amendments to the constitution, as the constitution protects property, of which they have large amounts both in land and slaves, which at the time are considered property. They work as hard as possible to avoid the stop as well as regulation of the slave trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 33:00:</u> Once it is increasingly obvious that the Southern Slave Owners will lose control of the government and therefore their slaves, they pack themselves into positions of power, most notably the Supreme Court. They then protect the Constitution as it was framed by the founders, claiming they are the only ones who are able and qualified to interpret the constitution. They attack the North for upholding not only democracy, but also voting rights, as they claim that they will vote for anything that will assist money in moving upwards and lean towards distribution of wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 37:13:</u>&nbsp; After the Civil War, the American South ceases to exist as a Democracy and turns into a one party system that is fed by white supremacy. In the effort to gain more votes to compensate for those lost in the American South, Republicans added 6 new States between 1889-1890. This is their effort at a power grab by adding 12 new Senators and 3 new Members to the Electoral college, without the support of the popular will. This increases opposition peaking in the disputed election Benjamin Harris, paired with increased voter suppression. These tactics mirror what happened in the most recent election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 41:25</u>: Under the tenure of Justice Melvin Fuller, The Supreme Court solely protected big business, with rulings in the favor of big business on issues such as Taxation, Plessi vs. Ferguson, as well as workers rights. They also acquire lands as &ldquo;Unincorporated Territories&rdquo; such as Puerto Rico, Guam and Samoa. This land acquisition specifically states the people on those lands are not American Citizens, which&nbsp; gives the American Government access to the industries, most notably sugar, without giving the citizens involvement in the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 51:43:</u>&nbsp; During the Presidency of Roosevelt, Democracy and Capitalism are viewed as Married, which is the trend. This is when Roosevelt starts the New Deal, which includes Workers rights, Social Security, promotion of Infrastructure, and most importantly Employment. He received almost immediate pushback, which was articulated in the Conservative Manifesto, which was written by Senators who supported private business and were vehemently opposed to anything that would cause a redistribution of wealth, claiming it as Communist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 55:49:</u> Under Eisenhower, Supreme Court Justice Earl Warner, and Nixon appoints Supreme Court Berger. Both stand against state discrimination of African americans, and later they integrate Civil rights for Women as well. To achieve this, they utilize the 14th Amendment. This later includes women's Reproductive rights. There is an effort to stop the rise of expanded rights which is noted in the Powell Memo. They decide to start &ldquo;think tanks&rdquo; and integrate themselves into Universities to achieve this. This later turns into the &ldquo;Orignalists&rdquo; whose interests are solely what is written in the original constitution, which means nothing about Healthcare, Equal rights, or Social Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Timestamp 1:00:44:</u> Although Regan is initially voted in under his stance on expanding the constitution, he later supports voter suppression to not let as many people vote to maintain a purist view of the constitution. This happens hand in hand with Gerrymandering, which isolates their voters in such a way that a certain party will inevitably win.</p>

Inspired by Eric Foner’s work on pre-Civil War Republican ideology, Richardson analyzed Republican economic policies during the war. She contended that their efforts to create an activist Federal Government during the Civil War marked a continuation of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as war bonds and greenbacks or the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act, revolutionized the role of the Federal Government in the U.S. economy. At the same time, these actions laid the groundwork for the Republican Party’s shift to Big Business after the Civil War.</div> </div> <div class="gallery"><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Heather_Cox_RICHARDSON_The_Death_of_Reconstruction?id=o0q8CjLc0k8C"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Y6Ejj785L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="Forest"></a> <div class="desc">In this 2001 book, Richardson "focused on the “Northern abandonment of Reconstruction.” Building on the earlier work of C. Vann Woodward, she argued that a more complete understanding of the period required appreciation of class, not only race. As Reconstruction continued into the 1870s and especially the 1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South more from a class perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their earlier humanitarianism. In the midst of the labor struggles of the Gilded Age, Republicans came to compare “the demands of the ex-slaves for land, social services, and civil rights” to the demands of white laborers in the North. This ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of Reconstruction, as they chose the protection of their economic and business interests over their desire for racial equality."

She incorporated the West into the discussion of Reconstruction as no predecessor had. Between 1865 and 1900, Americans re-imagined the role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its citizens. However, racism, sexism, and greed divided Americans, and the same people who increasingly benefited from government intervention—white, middle-class Americans—actively excluded African-Americans, Native Americans, immigrants, and organized laborers from the newfound bounties of their reconstructed nation."

She argued that party politics and opportunism led to Wounded Knee. After a bruising midterm election, President Benjamin Harrison needed to shore up his support. To do so, he turned to The Dakotas, where he replaced seasoned Indian agents with unqualified political allies, who incorrectly assumed that the Ghost Dance Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one third of its force in order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event, Republicans tried to paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats."

This book studied the entire life of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of George W. Bush. The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” a small group of wealthy white men who controlled all three branches of government. These Republicans articulated a new vision of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War, Republicans began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers and industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar process took place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle successful New Deal policies and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were able to return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first Theodore Roosevelt during the Progressive Era, and then Dwight D. Eisenhower, who enforced integration and maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another fall from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that Republicans treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise from humble beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the original Republicans."

United States victory in the American Civil War should have settled that tension forever, but at the same time that the Civil War was fought, Americans also started moving into the West. In the West, Americans found and expanded upon deep racial hierarchies, meaning that hierarchical values survived in American politics and culture despite the crushing defeat of the pro-slavery Confederacy. Those traditions--a rejection of democracy, an embrace of entrenched wealth, the marginalization of women and people of color--have found a home in modern conservative politics, leaving the tremendous promise of America unfulfilled."
