    <H1>George Lakoff</H1>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff">George Lakoff</a> is among the leading public intellectuals
    of our time, having written several books intended for lay
    audiences in addition to his considerable academic output. One way to understand his philosophic approach is to compare
    it to the more traditional view of thinkers such as Steven Pinker. Lakoff and Pinker have had a many decade long debate
    on the nature of mind, which became somewhat acrimonious and public around the time Lakoff published his book '<a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/books/chapters/0723-1st-lako.html">Whose
        Freedom</a>' (in which he sought to answer what conservatives mean by freedom, how conservatives achieve a
    'reversal' of
    freedoms as they are commonly understood, and why they do it*), which Pinker largely panned in the <a
        href="https://newrepublic.com/article/77730/block-metaphor-steven-pinker-whose-freedom-george-lakoff">New
        Republic</a> referring
    to it as a 'put-up job'. Lakoff gave a <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517092902/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/lakoff/whencognitivescienceenterspolitics">scathing
        response</a> to this critique, accusing Pinker of misunderstanding his
    work.</p>
    <p>While this public display didn't put either of them in their best light, the discourse highlighted some
    fundamental issues and controversies in the fields of cognitive science, philosophy of mind and linguistics, and their
    potential implications for our political discourse.
</p>
  
<p>Many of Lakoff's main ideas relevant to our current political discourse are mentioned in this 2018 discussion with
    Robert Reich.

*The meaning of 'freedom' has not been static, as European scholar <a
    href="http://www.anneliendedijn.yolasite.com/">Annelien de Dijn</a>
    (interviewed <a href="https://newbooksnetwork.com/annelien-de-dijn-freedom-an-unruly-history-harvard-up-2020/">here</a>) has
    described in her <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Freedom/UdHoDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1">sweep
    through Western history</a>, exploring how this concept has evolved,
    asking: <em>'Today most people tend to equate freedom with the possession of inalienable individual rights, rights that
    demarcate a private sphere no government may infringe on. But has this always been the case?</em>
