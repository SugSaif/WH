                Heather spoke about 1) Voter disenfranchisement, 2) Gerrymandering, 3) President Trump’s recent press
                briefings, 4)
                Jared Kushner’s recent comments about the national stockpile, and 5) whether a situation like the
                current one in the US
                has ever occurred before.
                <br><br>
                She mentioned voter disenfranchisement is not new, having started in the US in the late 1700’s with the
                loss of female
                suffrage. In the period after the civil war, when federal income taxes were introduced, many efforts to
                restrict votes
                of blacks, immigrants and poor people were put in place because of anxieties that these groups would try
                to siphon money
                away from the government. In this period fears about socialism and communism first took hold. Attempts
                in present times
                to restrict votes in many ways mirror these types of concerns. A specific form of disenfranchisement is
                Gerrymandering,
                which first occurred in the 18th century, but with the use of computer algorithms has become extremely
                potent in the
                21st century. Heather suggested that one reason the GOP is so aggressive about voter disenfranchisement
                is that without
                restriction of votes, it fears that it will lose its grip on power, given its increasingly minority
                status in the
                country. <br><br>
                The recent briefings that President Trump has held, given the combination of his mendacity and the
                seriousness of the
                situation with Coronavirus spreading in the US, has put mainstream media in a difficult position of
                having to decide how
                to cover these events. This occurring at a time when partisan media has a firm foothold in our daily
                discourse is
                particularly dangerous. <br><br>
                Heather mentioned Kushner’s comments about the national stockpile, which along with follow up comments
                in a later
                briefing by Trump, made it unclear whether the present administration sees the national stockpile as a
                resource for
                states or if it has some other purpose. She was concerned about states being forced to bid for precious
                medical supplies
                from private suppliers. <br><br>
                She closed with a comment on our current situation, where a quite radical right has challenged the
                mid-20th century’s
                liberal consensus in the US, which promoted sensible regulation, a safety net, and infrastructure. She
                reminded us that
                we have been in similar positions before, where one party controlled most of the organs of government
                and many of civil
                society-- in the 1850’s with the plantar elites (the so called "slave power"), and in the 1890’s with the robber barons—and we managed
                to negotiate
                our way through those times.

                        of the International Workingmen's Organization (also known as the First International), workers

                        united to overthrow the existing French regime which had failed to protect the city from
                        Prussian siege,
                        and formed the first truly democratic government in the city and in all of France. The elected
                        council of
                        the Commune passed socialist policies and oversaw city functions for just over two months, until
                        the
                        French army retook the city for the French government, slaughtering tens of thousands of

                        extended to
                        all men. While the right to vote was also eventually granted to women with the 19th Amendment in
                        1920,
                        white women were the main beneficiaries. Men and women of color would continue to fight to

                        culminating in the historic civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, which led to landmark
                        legislation that transformed American voting rights. But even today, activists and civil rights
                        groups
                        are continuing to fight voting laws they argue are discriminatory."</blockquote><br>

                        this
                        country, like the ones we've seen recently, are hardly a 21st-century invention. Entrenched
                        groups have
                        long tried to keep the vote out of the hands of the less powerful. Indeed, America began its
                        great
                        democratic experiment in the late 1700s by granting the right to vote to a narrow subset of
                        society —
                        white male landowners. Even as barriers to voting began receding in the ensuing decades, many
                        Southern
                        states erected new ones, such as poll taxes and literary tests, aimed at keeping the vote out of
                        the
                        hands of African American men. Over time, voting rights became a bipartisan priority as people
                        worked at
                        all levels to enact constitutional amendments and laws expanding access to the vote based on
                        race and
                        ethnicity, gender, disability, age and other factors. The landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965
                        passed by
                        Congress took major steps to curtail voter suppression. Thus began a new era of push-and-pull on
                        voting
                        rights, with the voting age reduced to 18 from 21 and the enshrinement of voting protections for
                        language
                        minorities and people with disabilities. Greater voter enfranchisement was met with fresh
                        resistance and
                        in 2013, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its ruling on Shelby County v.
                        Holder, paving
                        the way for states and jurisdictions with a history of voter suppression to enact restrictive
                        voter
                        identification laws. A whopping 23 states created new obstacles to voting in the decade leading
                        up to the
                        2018 elections, according to the nonpartisan coalition Election Protection."</blockquote><br>

                        Americans
                        (and many historians) present a narrative in which voting rights expanded in the early 19th
                        century, then
                        were retracted for African-American men in the 1880s, the history of disfranchisement
                        demonstrates the
                        long history of technical manipulation of voter registration, a practice that continues to shape
                        voting
                        rights in the United States. In the 1840s–1850s, Northern states pioneered modes of registration
                        designed
                        explicitly to limit Irish-American and other immigrant voting. Although this effort was halted
                        by the
                        Civil War’s expansive need for popular participation in the military, the practice resumed in
                        the 1870s
                        North, to confront later waves of immigration. When white Southern Democrats sought to restrict
                        the
                        franchise for freedpeople, they turned to these methods pioneered in New England. While we often
                        tell a
                        story of violence and fraud in the disfranchisement of African-Americans in the Jim Crow South,
                        the
                        reliance on technical tools of registration remind us of the long history of making voting
                        difficult in

                        days to
                        the 1890s, keeping the content of your vote secret was almost impossible. There was no

                        were a
                        good idea. Many people – and not just political operatives – thought secrecy was not a good
                        idea. In
                        those days there was no model for structuring elections so they could be private individual

                        An
                        ongoing state investigation into voter suppression was launched in Georgia last year after

                        Alabama remains
                        one of the most difficult places in the nation to cast a ballot. To make matters worse, the

                        democracy was never supposed to give the nation a president like Donald Trump. We have never had
                        a
                        president who gave rise to such widespread alarm about his lack of commitment to the
                        institutions of
                        self-government, to the norms democracy requires, and to the need for basic knowledge about how
                        government works. We have never had a president who raises profound questions about his basic
                        competence
                        and his psychological capacity to take on the most challenging political office in the world.
                        Yet if
                        Trump is both a threat to our democracy and a product of its weaknesses, the citizen activism he
                        has
                        inspired is the antidote. The reaction to the crisis created by Trump's presidency can provide
                        the
                        foundation for an era of democratic renewal and vindicate our long experiment in self-rule. The
                        award-winning authors of One Nation After Trump explain Trump's rise and the danger his
                        administration
                        poses to our free institutions. They also offer encouragement to the millions of Americans now
                        experiencing a new sense of citizenship and engagement and argue that our nation needs a
                        unifying
                        alternative to Trump's dark and divisive brand of politics--an alternative rooted in a New
                        Economy, a New
                        Patriotism, a New Civil Society, and a New Democracy. One Nation After Trump is the essential

                        while the U.S. had stockpiles of antibiotics for military troops, there was no such stash for

                        reportedly denied security clearance last year over concerns of foreign influence and private
                        business
                        interests, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. The Post, citing people familiar with the
                        situation,
                        identified Kushner as the "Senior White House Official 1" identified in House Oversight
                        Committee
                        documents released this week. According to the documents, the individual was denied security
                        clearance
                        initially by career officials before being overruled by Carl Kline, who headed the White House’s
                        personnel security office at the time.</blockquote><br>

                        upheld
                        state-imposed racial segregation. Justice Brown conceded that the 14th Amendment intended to
                        establish
                        absolute equality for the races before the law, but held that separate treatment did not imply
                        the
                        inferiority of African Americans. The Court noted that there was not a meaningful difference in

                        Twain coined
                        the phrase “Gilded Age” in a book he co-authored with Charles Dudley Warner in 1873, The Gilded
                        Age: A
                        Tale of Today. The book satirized the corruption of post-Civil War society and politics. Indeed,
                        popular
                        excitement over national growth and industrialization only thinly glossed over the stark
                        economic
                        inequalities and various degrees of corruption of the era. Politicians of the time largely
                        catered to
                        business interests in exchange for political support and wealth. Many participated in graft and
                        bribery,
                        often justifying their actions with the excuse that corruption was too widespread for a
                        successful
                        politician to resist. The machine politics of the cities, specifically Tammany Hall in New York,
                        illustrate the kind of corrupt, but effective, local and national politics that dominated the
                        era.
