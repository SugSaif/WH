    <H1>Isaiah Berlin - Two Notions of Freedom</H1>

<p>In this two and half minute clip, Berlin outlines two notions of liberty. </p>

<p>Later, Berlin in his classic essay <a href="https://cactus.dixie.edu/green/B_Readings/I_Berlin%20Two%20Concpets%20of%20Liberty.pdf"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">"TWO CONCEPTS OF LIBERTY"</a> mentions the "<em>'positive' sense of the word
        'liberty' [which] derives from the wish on the part of the individual to be his own master,</em>"
    and negative liberty which implies that "<em>the individual [is] not to be interfered with within a
        defined area</em>".</p>
<p>Berlin also (similar to Hobbes*) emphasizes laws and obligations, stating that following: "<em>Locke says
        `Where there is no law there is no freedom', because rational laws are directions to a man's `proper interests'
        or `general good'; and adds that since such laws are what `hedges us from bogs and precipices' they `ill deserve
        the name of confinement', and speaks of desires to escape from such laws as being irrational, forms of
        `licence', as `brutish', and so on. Montesquieu, forgetting his liberal moments, speaks of political liberty as
        being not permission to do what we want, or even what the law allows, but only `the power of doing what we ought
        to will', which Kant virtually repeats. Burke proclaims the individual's `right' to be restrained in his own
        interest, because `the presumed consent of every rational creature is in unison with the predisposed order of
        things...Auguste Comte, who asked `If we do not allow free thinking in chemistry or biology, why should we allow
        it in morals or politics?" and "Pluralism, with the measure of `negative' liberty that it entails, seems to me a
        truer and more humane ideal than the goals of those who seek in the great, disciplined, authoritarian structures
        the ideal of `positive' self mastery by classes, or peoples, or the whole of mankind</em>".</p>

        <p style="font-size: small;">*Hobbes, who is most associated with his state of nature claim in chapter 13
            of&nbsp; "Leviathan" about the life of man being "<em>solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and
                short,</em>'&nbsp; in<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3207/3207-h/3207-h.htm#link2HCH0014"

                chapter 14</a>&nbsp; notes: "<em>That a man be willing, when others are so too, as farre-forth, as for
                Peace, and defence of himselfe he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and
                <strong>be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against
                </strong><strong>himself</strong>e.</em>"</p>
