                In the previous two sessions of the American history chat on March 26 and April 2 (these can be accessed by clicking on
                the home button above), Heather defined the “American Paradox” (referring to the idea that equality for certain people
                depends on inequality for others) and its application in the South in the 19th century. Today Heather discussed the
                founding story in the American West of the rugged outdoorsman (symbolized by men such as Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett and
                Kit Carson) advancing civilization and taking on ‘savages’, as opposed to the notion of the yeoman farmer in the East.
                The propagation of this foundational Western myth required the development of racial hierarchies (with systematic
                othering of Mexicans, Chinese and Indigenous Americans), and it took cues from how this had been done in the South. This
                myth and the associated racial hierarchies were major factors that allowed the West to serve as a continual breeding
                ground for oligarchy.

                        source: Beginning in the 16th century, California's coastal peoples began catching glimpses of
                        an ominous and wondrous sight: strange oceangoing ships filled with bearded, pale-skinned men.
                        After conquering and plundering the Aztec empire in present-day Mexico City in 1519, Spanish
                        conquistadors were eagerly exploring northward, lured by rumors of fabulous golden cities.
                        Spanish explorers found the tip of what is now Baja California in 1533 and named it "California"
                        after a mythical island in a popular Spanish novel. Nine years later, a Spanish ship commanded
                        by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo sailed as far north as present-day Oregon, making several landings
                        along the way. During the following two centuries, Spanish galleons became frequent visitors to
                        California's waters, sailing through on their way from Manila to Acapulco. </blockquote><br>

                        unified “races,” Europeans endowed racial distinctions with legal force and philosophical and
                        scientific legitimacy, while Natives appropriated categories of “red” and “Indian,” and slaves
                        and freed people embraced those of “African” and “colored,” to imagine more expansive identities
                        and mobilize more successful resistance to Euro-American societies. The origin, scope, and
                        significance of “racial” difference were questions of considerable transatlantic debate in the
                        age of Enlightenment and they acquired particular political importance in the newly independent

                        lands across the Appalachian Mountains for further settlement, they needed explorers and
                        promoters. Daniel Boone was both. Born in Pennsylvania in 1734, he settled his family along the
                        Yadkin River in North Carolina in 1757. A decade later he traveled across the Appalachians to
                        explore and hunt in the rich area around the Kentucky River. Boone and his hunting partners
                        actually shared many values with the local Indians, but the goals of natives and newcomers
                        diverged when permanent settlement occurred. By 1775, Boone was leading settlers through the
                        Cumberland Gap along the Wilderness Road to the stockaded settlement of Boonesborough. He
                        described his most significant trip, which took place between 1769 and 1771, in this selection
                        from his 1784 “autobiography.” John Filson, a land speculator and author of Discovery,
                        Settlement and Present State of Kentucke, created Boone’s legend as a frontier hero by appending
                        a ghostwritten first person narrative by Boone to his promotional tract. Soon after, Boone
                        abandoned Kentucky because of disputed land claims, and he eventually died in Missouri in 1820.

                        Later he again served, that time as a Delegate from Kanawha County in present West Virginia,
                        after having been commander of Kanawha militia. Still later, with kinfolk and friends he moved
                        in 1799 to the Spanish territory of Missouri. There, in 1800, he was appointed Syndic
                        ("governing officer") of the vast portion of that territory north and west of the Missouri River
                        known as the Femme Osage district. As Syndic he was "commandant, sheriff, judge and jury." He
                        served until 1804, after the Louisiana Purchase by the United States. </blockquote><br>

                            target='_blank'> The Long Look West </a> <br> Quote from site: Jefferson's original overture
                        for a western exploratory party was directed to Revolutionary War hero, George Rogers Clark. He
                        begins his 1783 letter to Clark with the two topics which pulled his thoughts westward: science
                        and politics. He thanks Clark for sending him shells and seeds and assures him that he would be
                        pleased to have as many bones, teeth and tusks of the mammoth as Clark might be able to find.
                        Then within the same paragraph Jefferson reveals his apprehension at the rumor that money was
                        being raised in England for exploration between the Mississippi and the Pacific, and even though
                        it was professed as only for knowledge, he feared colonization. Jefferson then wonders, if money
                        could be raised in this country for western exploration, "How would you like to lead such a
                        party?" Clark declines Jefferson's request for financial reasons, but as a hero of the western
                        theatre of the Revolution, he was quite knowledgeable of the Indians of the northwest territory
                        and offered advice on how to best proceed among the Indian peoples, advice which Jefferson
                        stored away for future use. In later correspondence Clark would recommend his youngest brother,
                        William, as also knowledgeable of the Indian territory and, "well qualified almost for any
                        business." </blockquote><br>

                        1815-1848", a period in which "the United States chased its Manifest Destiny all the way to the

                        another book that covers the same period (“The Market Revolution: Jacksonian America,
                        1815-1846" by Charles Sellers), and written around the same time as Howe's book. 
                        
                        These books in many ways, take opposing views on the major
                        developments in the period, and on the presidency of Andrew Jackson. 
                            
                        Sellers explored shifts from an agrarian to an industrial market economy, and reactions to this
                        transition, in the early 19th century most characteristically animated by the figure of Andrew
                        Jackson, who for Sellers was a kind of hero. For Howe, John Quincy Adams is more the
                        protagonist, and the main 19th century development he emphasizes is not the evolution of the
                        market, but rather the communication revolution, with the growth of the postal system, the
                        telegraph, and newspapers. More fundamentally, according to Lepore, these two authors differed
                        on the relationship between capitalism and democracy: 'For Sellers, capitalism is the imported
                        kudzu strangling the native pine of democracy. For Howe, capitalism is more like compost,
                        feeding the soil where democracy grows.' Lepore lays out in some detail the point and
                        counterpoint back and forth between Sellers and Howe. Running through this review are quotes and
                        ideas from Thoreau's Walden, emphasizing self-reliance, frugality, and a disdain for the larger
                        political economy. Why did Lepore do this in the review? Perhaps it was to balance the slight
                        favor she seems to show in the review to views espoused by Howe (by usually giving him the final
                        word in the way she laid out examples illustrating the two opposing arguments). Walden, acting
                        as a counterpoint to Lepore's own voice, gave some of this favored status back. She does
                        mitigate Thoreau's impact a bit at the end by noting that 'he cherished his manly
                        self-sufficiency (even though he carried his dirty laundry to Concord for his mother to wash).'

                        September 29, 1835, a detachment of the Mexican army arrived in Gonzales, Texas, a Mexican
                        state, to confiscate a cannon . The cannon was well hidden, but eighteen armed men stood in
                        plain sight. They taunted the Mexicans to "come and take it." The two sides talked and dickered,
                        but no action was taken. However, the little band of men grew to 167 in two days. Early the next
                        morning the Texans attacked the Mexican camp believing they were going to attack that day (Lord
                        38). With this attack the Texas Revolution was started. It was a revolution that Texas would
                        eventually win. One of the greatest helps to the Texan cause was Santa Anna, the Mexican
                        president, who provided the cause for revolution, stirred up the Texans' anger and zeal, and

                        Quote from the site: The commonly-accepted version of facts and events of the Battle of the
                        Alamo is that a handful of brave (and heavily outnumbered) English-speaking Anglo-Saxon American
                        rebels (called Texians) defended Fort Alamo near San Antonio.They were supposedly fighting for
                        their right to freedom and independence from the tyrannical oppression of the Mexican government
                        (Texas was then a part of Mexico, which had itself recently achieved independence from Spain).
                        The leader of the defense, Colonel Travis, apparently drew a line in the sand and asked for
                        those willing to give their lives defending the fort to step forward. All but one man crossed,
                        despite knowing that death was an inevitability. After a thirteen-day siege and a climactic two
                        hour battle, all 189 fort defenders died in battle. Davy Crockett died with his trusty rifle,
                        “Old Betsy” in his hands, with dozens of dead Mexicans troops at his feet. <b>Many of the
                            aforementioned “facts” about the battle contain grains of truth, but much of them are clear
                            embellishments. First and foremost is the falsehood that the defenders of the Alamo were
                            righteous revolutionaries oppressed by the tyrannical Mexican regime.</b>[emphasis added]

                        declaration of war on May 13, 1846. Hostilities continued for the next two years as General
                        Taylor led his troops through to Monterrey, and General Stephen Kearny and his men went to New

                        known for his camel experiment: the importation of some seventy-five camels for military testing
                        in Texas and the southwest in the late 1850s. He launched the offbeat operation while serving as
                        secretary of war under President Franklin Pierce, an exceptionally creative period in Davis’s
                        life. Among other efforts, Secretary Davis ordered surveys for a transcontinental railroad,
                        organized new cavalry regiments, and purchased the camels. The Army’s camel trials, which
                        included surveying expeditions in Texas’s Big Bend region and along the 35th parallel to
                        California, went well until the Civil War cut them short. By 1866, the surviving animals had
                        been sold to circuses and mining companies or simply turned loose to fend for themselves.

                        Chinese immigrants had come to San Francisco as early as 1838, but large numbers of Chinese only
                        began to come in 1850 for the same reason many Americans were flocking to California - the 1849
                        Gold Rush. The Chinese immigrants were mainly peasant farmers who left home because of economic
                        and political troubles in China. Most intended to work hard, make a lot of money, and then
                        return to their families and villages as wealthy men. In this goal, the Chinese did not differ
                        from many immigrants who came to the United States in the 19th century. Living together in
                        communities and neighborhoods, they, like all immigrants, maintained their culture. However,
                        while many Americans looked down on all immigrants, the Chinese were considered racially as well
                        as culturally inferior. Most Americans believed that the Chinese were too different to ever
                        assimilate successfully into American culture. This view was expressed and reinforced by the
                        stereotypic images of Chinese immigrants recorded in the media of the time. </blockquote><br>

                            California </a> <br> Quote from site: In the second half of the nineteenth century,
                        California was the most racially diverse region of the United States. Home to Asians, African
                        Americans, Native Americans, Latinos and European Americans, California was the first place
                        Americans struggled with the task of constructing a multi-racial society of free people.
                        Initially, Californians dealt with that diversity by ignoring it. Before the Civil War,
                        California law recognized only a simple division between white and non-white, effectively
                        treating all non-whites the same. Historians of California’s racial past have generally trod a
                        similar path, writing histories of racial experience in which each non-white racial group was
                        similarly oppressed by white racism. Yet by the end of the Reconstruction era, California law
                        not only recognized differences between non-white racial groups, it treated each racial group
                        differently. Amidst the turmoil of Civil War and Reconstruction, Californians developed a
                        complicated racial hierarchy that drew distinctions between non-white racial groups even as it
                        set whites apart from, and above, other races. This dissertation traces the process by which
                        Californians, white and non-white, organized their society around racial difference, and
                        examines the ideas and practices which justified their new racial scheme. The new racial
                        hierarchy encouraged competition between non-whites for position within the scale, effectively
                        legitimizing that scale and enlisting non-whites in support of white supremacy. By emphasizing
                        the ways in which California’s non-white minorities cooperated with and competed against each
                        other in their battles with white oppression, this new interpretation reveals a more muscular
                        racial dynamic at work in the maintenance of white supremacy during the nineteenth century than
                        previously acknowledged. This dissertation’s multi-racial, western perspective challenges
                        traditional arguments concerning the development of white racial identity in nineteenth-century
                        America which focus exclusively on binary relationships between black and white, free labor and
                        slave. Finally, through its focus on law and Reconstruction, this thesis connects the histories
                        of the South and West, and renders both regional histories central to national history

                        War and Reconstruction, political scientist Forrest Nabors argues that the problem of plutocracy
                        and the fate of the Confederacy were always deeply intertwined. Beginning in the 1830s, the
                        United States had become not one country, but two: a northern republican regime that remained
                        true to the vision of the founders, and a southern oligarchic regime that rejected the country’s
                        original core values. In Nabors’s telling, the fundamental clash between North and South was not
                        over slavery or states’ rights, but over which of these two political ideals would prevail.

                        complex, dynamic, and nuanced than was once believed.5 From the beginning, racial and ethnic
                        conflict have been embedded in the matrix of California's development. The pre-statehood
                        invasion of an army of Anglo-American and European immigrant entrepreneurs and gold seekers
                        overwhelmed, supplanted, and eventually delegitimated Indians, Californios, African Americans,

                        Many of the monuments have been removed or renamed in the recent national reckoning with
                        Confederate iconography. But for much of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, they
                        stood as totems to the “Lost Cause” in the American West. Despite a vast literature on the
                        origins, evolution, and enduring influence of the Lost Cause myth, little is known about how
                        this ideology impacted the political culture and physical space of the American West. This

                        culture in the twentieth century. California chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
                        (UDC) carried out much of this commemorative work. They emerged in California shortly after the
                        organization's founding in Tennessee in 1894 and, over the course of a century, emblazoned the
                        Western map with salutes to a slaveholding rebellion. In the process, the UDC and other
                        Confederate organizations triggered a continental struggle over Civil War memory that continues

                        impact it had at the time and the way it has been remembered. Or rather, lost and then
                        rediscovered. Sand Creek was the My Lai of its day, a war crime exposed by soldiers and
                        condemned by the U.S. government. It fueled decades of war on the Great Plains. And yet, over
                        time, the massacre receded from white memory, to the point where even locals were unaware of
                        what had happened in their own backyard. </blockquote><br>

                         <div class="desc">[From wikipedia] Richardson’s first book, The Greatest Nation of the Earth (1997), stemmed
                             from her dissertation at Harvard University. Inspired by Eric Foner’s work on pre-Civil War
                             Republican ideology, Richardson analyzed Republican economic policies during the war. She
                             contended that their efforts to create an activist Federal Government during the Civil War
                             marked a continuation of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as war bonds
                             and greenbacks or the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act, revolutionized the role
                             of the Federal Government in the U.S. economy. At the same time, these actions laid the
                             groundwork for the Republican Party’s shift to Big Business after the Civil War.</div>

                <div class="desc">In this 2001 book, Richardson "focused on the “Northern abandonment of Reconstruction.” Building
                    on the earlier work of C. Vann Woodward, she argued that a more complete understanding of the period
                    required appreciation of class, not only race. As Reconstruction continued into the 1870s and
                    especially the 1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South more from a class
                    perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their earlier humanitarianism. In
                    the midst of the labor struggles of the Gilded Age, Republicans came to compare “the demands of the
                    ex-slaves for land, social services, and civil rights” to the demands of white laborers in the
                    North. This ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of Reconstruction, as they chose
                    the protection of their economic and business interests over their desire for racial equality."

                <div class="desc">In this 2007 book, "Richardson presented Reconstruction as a national event that
                    impacted all Americans, not just those in the South. She incorporated the West into the
                    discussion of Reconstruction as no predecessor had. Between 1865 and 1900, Americans re-imagined the
                    role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its citizens. However,
                    racism, sexism, and greed divided Americans, and the same people who increasingly benefited from
                    government intervention—white, middle-class Americans—actively excluded African-Americans, Native
                    Americans, immigrants, and organized laborers from the newfound bounties of their reconstructed
                    nation." [from wikipedia] </div>

                            slaughter of Native Americans in South Dakota in 1890. She argued that party politics
                            and opportunism led to Wounded Knee. After a bruising midterm election, President Benjamin
                            Harrison needed to shore up his support. To do so, he turned to The Dakotas, where he
                            replaced seasoned Indian agents with unqualified political allies, who incorrectly assumed
                            that the Ghost Dance Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one third of its
                            force in order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event, Republicans tried to
                            paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats." [wikipedia] </div>

                        <div class="desc">In this 2014 book, Richardson "extended her study of the Republican
                            Party into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This book studied the entire life
                            of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of George W. Bush.
                            The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” a small group of wealthy white men
                            who controlled all three branches of government. These Republicans articulated a new vision
                            of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War, Republicans
                            began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers and
                            industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar process took
                            place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle successful New Deal policies
                            and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were able to
                            return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first Theodore Roosevelt
                            during the Progressive Era, and then Dwight D. Eisenhower, who enforced integration and
                            maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another
                            fall from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that Republicans
                            treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise from humble
                            beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the original
                            Republicans." [wikipedia]</div>

                             <div class="desc">In her most recent publication, Richardson argues "that America was founded with
                                 contradicting ideals, with the ideas of liberty, equality, and opportunity on one hand,
                                 and slavery and hierarchy on the other. United States victory in the American Civil War
                                 should have settled that tension forever, but at the same time that the Civil War was
                                 fought, Americans also started moving into the West. In the West, Americans found and
                                 expanded upon deep racial hierarchies, meaning that hierarchical values survived in
                                 American politics and culture despite the crushing defeat of the pro-slavery
                                 Confederacy. Those traditions--a rejection of democracy, an embrace of entrenched
                                 wealth, the marginalization of women and people of color--have found a home in modern
                                 conservative politics, leaving the tremendous promise of America unfulfilled." [wikipedia]</div>
