                In the previous two sessions of the American history chat on March 26 and April 2 (these can be accessed by clicking on the home button above), Heather defined the “American Paradox” (equality for certain people depends on inequality for others) and
                its application in the South in the 19th century. Today Heather discussed the
                founding story in the American West of the rugged outdoorsman (symbolized by men such as Daniel Boone,
                Davy Crockett and Kit Carson) taking on ‘savages’ and advancing civilization, as opposed to the notion
                of the yeoman farmer in the East. The propagation of this foundational myth required the development of
                racial hierarchies (with systematic othering of Indigenous, Chinese, and Mexican Americans), taking cues
                from how this hand been done in the South, served as a continued breeding ground for oligarchy, and
                continues to affect American discourse to this day.

                        source: Beginning in the 16th century, California's coastal peoples began catching glimpses of
                        an ominous and wondrous sight: strange oceangoing ships filled with bearded, pale-skinned men.
                        After conquering and plundering the Aztec empire in present-day Mexico City in 1519, Spanish
                        conquistadors were eagerly exploring northward, lured by rumors of fabulous golden cities.
                        Spanish explorers found the tip of what is now Baja California in 1533 and named it "California"
                        after a mythical island in a popular Spanish novel. Nine years later, a Spanish ship commanded
                        by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo sailed as far north as present-day Oregon, making several landings
                        along the way. During the following two centuries, Spanish galleons became frequent visitors to
                        California's waters, sailing through on their way from Manila to Acapulco. </blockquote><br>

                        unified “races,” Europeans endowed racial distinctions with legal force and philosophical and
                        scientific legitimacy, while Natives appropriated categories of “red” and “Indian,” and slaves
                        and freed people embraced those of “African” and “colored,” to imagine more expansive identities
                        and mobilize more successful resistance to Euro-American societies. The origin, scope, and
                        significance of “racial” difference were questions of considerable transatlantic debate in the
                        age of Enlightenment and they acquired particular political importance in the newly independent
                        United States. </blockquote><br>

                        lands across the Appalachian Mountains for further settlement, they needed explorers and
                        promoters. Daniel Boone was both. Born in Pennsylvania in 1734, he settled his family along the
                        Yadkin River in North Carolina in 1757. A decade later he traveled across the Appalachians to
                        explore and hunt in the rich area around the Kentucky River. Boone and his hunting partners
                        actually shared many values with the local Indians, but the goals of natives and newcomers
                        diverged when permanent settlement occurred. By 1775, Boone was leading settlers through the
                        Cumberland Gap along the Wilderness Road to the stockaded settlement of Boonesborough. He
                        described his most significant trip, which took place between 1769 and 1771, in this selection
                        from his 1784 “autobiography.” John Filson, a land speculator and author of Discovery,
                        Settlement and Present State of Kentucke, created Boone’s legend as a frontier hero by appending
                        a ghostwritten first person narrative by Boone to his promotional tract. Soon after, Boone
                        abandoned Kentucky because of disputed land claims, and he eventually died in Missouri in 1820.

                        having been elected in 1780 as a Delegate from Virginia's Fayette County in present Kentucky.
                        Later he again served, that time as a Delegate from Kanawha County in present West Virginia,
                        after having been commander of Kanawha militia. Still later, with kinfolk and friends he moved
                        in 1799 to the Spanish territory of Missouri. There, in 1800, he was appointed Syndic
                        ("governing officer") of the vast portion of that territory north and west of the Missouri River
                        known as the Femme Osage district. As Syndic he was "commandant, sheriff, judge and jury." He
                        served until 1804, after the Louisiana Purchase by the United States. </blockquote><br>

                            target='_blank'> The Long Look West </a> <br> Quote from site: Jefferson's original overture
                        for a western exploratory party was directed to Revolutionary War hero, George Rogers Clark. He
                        begins his 1783 letter to Clark with the two topics which pulled his thoughts westward: science
                        and politics. He thanks Clark for sending him shells and seeds and assures him that he would be
                        pleased to have as many bones, teeth and tusks of the mammoth as Clark might be able to find.
                        Then within the same paragraph Jefferson reveals his apprehension at the rumor that money was
                        being raised in England for exploration between the Mississippi and the Pacific, and even though
                        it was professed as only for knowledge, he feared colonization. Jefferson then wonders, if money
                        could be raised in this country for western exploration, "How would you like to lead such a
                        party?" Clark declines Jefferson's request for financial reasons, but as a hero of the western
                        theatre of the Revolution, he was quite knowledgeable of the Indians of the northwest territory
                        and offered advice on how to best proceed among the Indian peoples, advice which Jefferson
                        stored away for future use. In later correspondence Clark would recommend his youngest brother,
                        William, as also knowledgeable of the Indian territory and, "well qualified almost for any
                        business." </blockquote><br>

                        Plains. Riding on recently acquired horses, the Comanche hunted, traded, and made war across a
                        huge expanse of the Southwest. Mobility, as well as economic and militaristic supremacy, made
                        them the first culture to sustain dominance of the frontier Texas region. The Comanche were
                        formidable enough to block European expansion into their homeland for over 150 years, a feat no
                        other Native American tribe achieved. The tribe called themselves Numunah, simply “Our People.”
                        The Spanish, however, called this region Comancheria––the Comanche Empire. </blockquote><br>

                        September 29, 1835, a detachment of the Mexican army arrived in Gonzales, Texas, a Mexican
                        state, to confiscate a cannon . The cannon was well hidden, but eighteen armed men stood in
                        plain sight. They taunted the Mexicans to "come and take it." The two sides talked and dickered,
                        but no action was taken. However, the little band of men grew to 167 in two days. Early the next
                        morning the Texans attacked the Mexican camp believing they were going to attack that day (Lord
                        38). With this attack the Texas Revolution was started. It was a revolution that Texas would
                        eventually win. One of the greatest helps to the Texan cause was Santa Anna, the Mexican
                        president, who provided the cause for revolution, stirred up the Texans' anger and zeal, and
                        caused the Texans to win the final battle at San Jacinto. </blockquote><br>

                        Quote from the site: The commonly-accepted version of facts and events of the Battle of the
                        Alamo is that a handful of brave (and heavily outnumbered) English-speaking Anglo-Saxon American
                        rebels (called Texians) defended Fort Alamo near San Antonio.They were supposedly fighting for
                        their right to freedom and independence from the tyrannical oppression of the Mexican government
                        (Texas was then a part of Mexico, which had itself recently achieved independence from Spain).
                        The leader of the defense, Colonel Travis, apparently drew a line in the sand and asked for
                        those willing to give their lives defending the fort to step forward. All but one man crossed,
                        despite knowing that death was an inevitability. After a thirteen-day siege and a climactic two
                        hour battle, all 189 fort defenders died in battle. Davy Crockett died with his trusty rifle,
                        “Old Betsy” in his hands, with dozens of dead Mexicans troops at his feet. <b>Many of the
                            aforementioned “facts” about the battle contain grains of truth, but much of them are clear
                            embellishments. First and foremost is the falsehood that the defenders of the Alamo were
                            righteous revolutionaries oppressed by the tyrannical Mexican regime.</b>[emphasis added]

                        government. Yet by repealing the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had outlawed slavery

                        Chinese immigrants had come to San Francisco as early as 1838, but large numbers of Chinese only
                        began to come in 1850 for the same reason many Americans were flocking to California - the 1849
                        Gold Rush. The Chinese immigrants were mainly peasant farmers who left home because of economic
                        and political troubles in China. Most intended to work hard, make a lot of money, and then
                        return to their families and villages as wealthy men. In this goal, the Chinese did not differ
                        from many immigrants who came to the United States in the 19th century. Living together in
                        communities and neighborhoods, they, like all immigrants, maintained their culture. However,
                        while many Americans looked down on all immigrants, the Chinese were considered racially as well
                        as culturally inferior. Most Americans believed that the Chinese were too different to ever
                        assimilate successfully into American culture. This view was expressed and reinforced by the
                        stereotypic images of Chinese immigrants recorded in the media of the time. </blockquote><br>

                            California </a> <br> Quote from site: In the second half of the nineteenth century,
                        California was the most racially diverse region of the United States. Home to Asians, African
                        Americans, Native Americans, Latinos and European Americans, California was the first place
                        Americans struggled with the task of constructing a multi-racial society of free people.
                        Initially, Californians dealt with that diversity by ignoring it. Before the Civil War,
                        California law recognized only a simple division between white and non-white, effectively
                        treating all non-whites the same. Historians of California’s racial past have generally trod a
                        similar path, writing histories of racial experience in which each non-white racial group was
                        similarly oppressed by white racism. Yet by the end of the Reconstruction era, California law
                        not only recognized differences between non-white racial groups, it treated each racial group
                        differently. Amidst the turmoil of Civil War and Reconstruction, Californians developed a
                        complicated racial hierarchy that drew distinctions between non-white racial groups even as it
                        set whites apart from, and above, other races. This dissertation traces the process by which
                        Californians, white and non-white, organized their society around racial difference, and
                        examines the ideas and practices which justified their new racial scheme. The new racial
                        hierarchy encouraged competition between non-whites for position within the scale, effectively
                        legitimizing that scale and enlisting non-whites in support of white supremacy. By emphasizing
                        the ways in which California’s non-white minorities cooperated with and competed against each
                        other in their battles with white oppression, this new interpretation reveals a more muscular
                        racial dynamic at work in the maintenance of white supremacy during the nineteenth century than
                        previously acknowledged. This dissertation’s multi-racial, western perspective challenges
                        traditional arguments concerning the development of white racial identity in nineteenth-century
                        America which focus exclusively on binary relationships between black and white, free labor and
                        slave. Finally, through its focus on law and Reconstruction, this thesis connects the histories
                        of the South and West, and renders both regional histories central to national history

                        War and Reconstruction, political scientist Forrest Nabors argues that the problem of plutocracy
                        and the fate of the Confederacy were always deeply intertwined. Beginning in the 1830s, the
                        United States had become not one country, but two: a northern republican regime that remained
                        true to the vision of the founders, and a southern oligarchic regime that rejected the country’s
                        original core values. In Nabors’s telling, the fundamental clash between North and South was not
                        over slavery or states’ rights, but over which of these two political ideals would prevail.

                        the past two decades historians have begun to reassess California's his­tory, probing the
                        notions of inevitability, progress, race, gender, and politics to reveal a context far more
                        complex, dynamic, and nuanced than was once believed.5 From the beginning, racial and ethnic
                        conflict have been embedded in the matrix of California's development. The pre-statehood
                        invasion of an army of Anglo-American and European immigrant entrepreneurs and gold seekers
                        overwhelmed, supplanted, and eventually delegitimated Indians, Californios, African Americans,
                        Asians, and other people of color. The influx of white Americans gave rise to "Anglo" domination
                        and established a society that severely marginalized California's other populations.

                        Many of the monuments have been removed or renamed in the recent national reckoning with
                        Confederate iconography. But for much of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, they
                        stood as totems to the “Lost Cause” in the American West. Despite a vast literature on the
                        origins, evolution, and enduring influence of the Lost Cause myth, little is known about how
                        this ideology impacted the political culture and physical space of the American West. This

                        culture in the twentieth century. California chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
                        (UDC) carried out much of this commemorative work. They emerged in California shortly after the
                        organization's founding in Tennessee in 1894 and, over the course of a century, emblazoned the
                        Western map with salutes to a slaveholding rebellion. In the process, the UDC and other
                        Confederate organizations triggered a continental struggle over Civil War memory that continues
