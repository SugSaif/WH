            Having set up the “American paradox” in previous chats, today Heather discussed the period of
            Reconstruction, with the ascent of Andrew Johnson after the death of Lincoln, Johnson's generally lenient
            policies towards the South, violence in the South after the civil war, the appearance of “black codes” and
            the establishment of the Freedmen's bureau. <br><br>

            During this period, in the South, there was a change in justification for the war from a “defense of
            slavery” to that of “states’ rights”. Fears about taxes leading to redistribution of income to blacks and
            immigrants took hold, and were exacerbated by news about the Paris commune. Attempts of the government to
            develop programs for social welfare led to accusations of ‘communism’. At the same time, a myth was
            developing in the West, that of the ‘cowboy’. Underlying this myth was a continuing legacy of racial
            hierarchies.

                        have said since then that it was about states' rights, but really the only significant state
                        right that people were arguing about in 1860 was the right to own what was known as slave
                        property — property and slaves unimpeded — and to be able to travel with that property anywhere
                        that you wanted to. So it's clear that this was really about slavery in almost every significant
                        way, but we've sort of pushed that to the side because of course we want to believe that our
                        country is a country that's always stood for freedom. And ... certainly it's difficult for some
                        Southern Americans to accept that their ancestors fought a war on behalf of slavery. And I think
                        that Northerners really, for the cause of national reconciliation, decided to push that aside —
                        decided to accept Southerners' denials or demurrals. </blockquote><br>

                        owned a handful of slaves and had supported the Democratic Party’s proslavery agenda before the
                        war, Johnson gradually came to support emancipation as a war measure—a means to punish the
                        Confederate elite and rob them of resources. </blockquote><br>

                            target='_blank'> The Former Slaves of Andrew Johnson </a> <br> QUOTE: Johnson’s close
                        association with Abraham Lincoln, as both his vice president and his successor, often disguises
                        Johnson’s own slave ownership. He is a complicated example of a southerner who simultaneously
                        supported the Union and gradual emancipation while perpetuating slavery through the bondage of
                        others—perhaps even fathering children with his enslaved servant. Some of these enslaved
                        individuals were later freed and brought to work at the White House during the Johnson
                        administration. While Andrew Johnson was loyal to the North and pompously referred to himself as
                        the “Moses of the colored men,” his legacy, largely measured by his mishandling of
                        Reconstruction politics after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, remains marred by racial
                        prejudice. </blockquote><br>
                    <blockquote><a href='https://prezi.com/bahfz2lupbw7/johnsons-vetoes/' target='_blank'> Johnson
                            Vetoes on 1866 </a> <br> During Johnson's presidency, Congress tried to pass two major
                        bills. The Freedman's Bureau Bill and the Civil Right's Bill of 1866. By this time, Johnson was
                        rather unpopular with the North due to his leniency with the South and his rather racist
                        beliefs. Part of the reason Johnson reacted so strongly to these two bills is because Johnson,
                        like Andrew Jackson, was a strong supporter of states rights. These two bills not only refuted
                        his own ideals that African Americans didn't deserve the rights they were given but also
                        asserted federal power over the states. Unfortunately for Johnson, both bills ended up passing.

                        self-rule. During the summer and fall of 1865, most of the old Confederate states held
                        constitutional conventions. President Johnson’s reconstruction plan permitted only white persons
                        to vote for convention delegates or to participate in the framing of the new state governments.
                        Not surprisingly, none of the state conventions considered extending the right to vote to the
                        freedmen. South Carolina’s provisional governor declared at his state constitutional convention
                        that “this is a white man’s government.” </blockquote><br>

                        President Abraham Lincoln took a moderate position on Reconstruction of the South and proposed
                        plans to bring the South back into the Union as quickly and easily as possible. During this
                        time, the Radical Republicans used Congress to block Lincoln’s moderate approach. They sought to
                        impose harsh terms on the South, thinking Lincoln’s approach too lenient, as well as to upgrade
                        the rights of freedmen (former slaves). The moderate position, held both by Lincoln and Vice
                        President Andrew Johnson (who took over the presidency after Lincoln’s death), prevailed until
                        the election of 1866, at which point the Radicals were able to take control of policy, remove
                        former Confederates from power, and enfranchise the freedmen. A Republican coalition came to
                        power in nearly all of the Southern states and set out to transform the society by setting up a
                        free-labor economy, with support from the army and the Freedmen’s Bureau. </blockquote><br>

                        throughout the South. In outright defiance of the Republican-led federal government, Southern
                        Democrats formed organizations that violently intimidated blacks and Republicans who tried to
                        win political power. The most prominent of these, the Ku Klux Klan, was formed in Pulaski,
                        Tennessee, in 1865. Originally founded as a social club for former Confederate soldiers, the
                        Klan evolved into a terrorist organization. It would be responsible for thousands of deaths, and
                        would help to weaken the political power of Southern blacks and Republicans. </blockquote><br>

                             marked a continuation of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as war bonds
                             and greenbacks or the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act, revolutionized the role

                    on the earlier work of C. Vann Woodward, she argued that a more complete understanding of the period
                    required appreciation of class, not only race. As Reconstruction continued into the 1870s and
                    especially the 1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South more from a class
                    perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their earlier humanitarianism. In
                    the midst of the labor struggles of the Gilded Age, Republicans came to compare “the demands of the
                    ex-slaves for land, social services, and civil rights” to the demands of white laborers in the
                    North. This ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of Reconstruction, as they chose
                    the protection of their economic and business interests over their desire for racial equality."

                    role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its citizens. However,

                            of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of George W. Bush.
                            The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” a small group of wealthy white men
                            who controlled all three branches of government. These Republicans articulated a new vision

                            began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers and
                            industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar process took
                            place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle successful New Deal policies
                            and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were able to
                            return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first Theodore Roosevelt

                            maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another
                            fall from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that Republicans
                            treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise from humble
                            beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the original
                            Republicans." [wikipedia]</div>

                             <div class="desc">In her most recent publication, Richardson argues "that America was founded with
                                 contradicting ideals, with the ideas of liberty, equality, and opportunity on one hand,
                                 and slavery and hierarchy on the other. United States victory in the American Civil War
                                 should have settled that tension forever, but at the same time that the Civil War was
                                 fought, Americans also started moving into the West. In the West, Americans found and
                                 expanded upon deep racial hierarchies, meaning that hierarchical values survived in
                                 American politics and culture despite the crushing defeat of the pro-slavery
                                 Confederacy. Those traditions--a rejection of democracy, an embrace of entrenched
                                 wealth, the marginalization of women and people of color--have found a home in modern
                                 conservative politics, leaving the tremendous promise of America unfulfilled." [wikipedia]</div>
