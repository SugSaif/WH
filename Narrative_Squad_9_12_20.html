    <h1>Narrative Squad September 12, 2020</h1>

    <h2>Mass Media Disinformation</h2>
    <p>Major purveyors of information that is false and misleading include many broadcasters on AM-talk radio, Fox New,
        Sinclair media, and OANN. Most of us are familar with these networks and what they do, but for a very good
        summary of both their impact and some of the history of how these networks developed, a 'must-see' movie is 'The
        Brainwashing of my Dad', which can be <a href="https://www.thebrainwashingofmydad.com/streaming-services">viewed
            online for free (depending on your providers) or for a small fee</a>. </p>
    <p>Through interviews with "media luminaries, cognitive linguists, grassroots activist groups such as: Noam Chomsky,
        Steve Rendall, Jeff Cohen, Eric Boehlert, George Lakoff, Carol Wallin from STOP RUSH, HearYourselfThink, Claire
        Conner and others, “Brainwashing” unravels the plan to shift the country to the Right over the last 30 years,
        largely through media manipulation. The result has led to fewer voices, less diversity of opinion, massive
        intentional misinformation and greater division of our country."
        <a href="https://sugsaif.github.io/WH/Consolidated_links_Movie_Night.html">These are links to sources</a> that
        cover topics raised in the movie or that came up during the discussion after our local screening of The
        Brainwashing of My Dad some time ago, and <a href="https://www.thebrainwashingofmydad.com/read-about-it">these
            are links</a> (proceeds from sales may support the producers of the movie if you buy books through this
        site) to books that provide deeper background. </p>
    <p>Spending some time exploring the information in the links <b>after</b> watching the movie, and perhaps reading
        one or two of the recommended books could be, particularly if this information is discussed with others, the
        equivalent of a college course on this subject.</p>





    <h2>Online</h2>
    <p>This is a cesspool, where figures and entities of all sorts exist including Q-anon, presenters on <a
            href="https://time.com/5881595/right-wing-conspiracy-theorists-coronavirus/">D-live</a>
, Alex
        Jones' Infowars, the so-called '<a href="https://sugsaif.github.io/WH/Narrative_Squad_IDW.html">intellectual
            dark-web</a>', social media groups, and
            <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/taking-the-red-pill/10452032">red pill
                communities</a>. </p>

    <h2>Stealth</h2>
    <p>There are now, unfortunately, <a href="https://sugsaif.github.io/WH/Books_about_KochBros.html">many stealth
            right-wing networks</a>. By 'stealth' what is meant here is that they do many of their activities behind the
        scenes, exert a tremendous amount of influence without much public comment, maintain 'secretive' activites over
        a very long time (decades), and often receive large amounts of funding from 'dark' sources whose interests they
        serve and protect. Not everything they do is in secret. They usually have very specific tactics that are public
        and often highly effective. Three of the most important are <b>the Koch network</b>, <b>the Council for National
            Policy</b>, and the <b>Federalist Society</b>.</p>
