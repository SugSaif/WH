    <h1>What is antibody testing for Coronavirus, and will it end social distancing?</h1>

    <p>Updated April 4, 2020</p>

    <p>There are two general types of testing for Coronavirus. The first utilizes sampling based on swabs of the nose and mouth, and looks for the genetic material of the virus. This is used to check for active infections. For the second type,
    blood samples are collected to check for the presence of <b>antibodies</b> to the
    virus.</a></p>
    
    <p>Until recently, all testing in the US has been of the first type, but recently the a <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/health/coronavirus-antibody-test.html">FDA approved the first
            antibody
            test</a>, which may allow for widespread use of this eventually.</p>
   
   
    <p>The reason this is important is because antibody testing may indicate immunity to the virus, and may allow people
        who test positive for this to no longer need social distancing. Although there are some caveats to this, persons
        with antibodies may not only be at negligible risk of getting sick from the virus, but they may also not be
        carriers, allowing for the possibility of <a
            href="https://github.com/jsweitz/covid_immune_shields/blob/master/restir_covid.pdf">'immune
            shielding'</a>. There are even early proposals to 'certify' people who have this. For example in the UK this
            is being referred to as an <a
                href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/health/immunity-passport-coronavirus-lockdown-intl/index.html">'immunity
                passport'</a>. </p>
            

    <p>It remains to be seen how quickly this can be applied generally.  So far there is no indication that the Defense Production Act will be used for this, so at the moment this will depend on normal supply chain and pricing mechanisms.  The potential payoff is big, because widespread testing may provide for a safe way to resume many activities related to daily life and the economy.</p></p>
