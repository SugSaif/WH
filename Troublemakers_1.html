"RIP WFB â€” in hell" - <a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/gore-vidal-speaks-seriously-ill-of-the-dead-2/">so said
        Gore Vidal</a> upon the death of William F. Buckley in 2008. 
<br><br>



In her May 7, 2020 <a href="https://sugsaif.github.io/WH/HCR_History_5_7_2020.html">history
        chat</a>, Heather Cox Richardson covered the development of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_conservatism">movement conservatism</a> from the
mid-20th century to the so-called Reagan revolution.






The pivotal role of William F Buckley became apparent, which generated some discussion in facebook forums. The post-war liberal consensus (which may be characterized as the acceptance of the need for government to provide
social programs, sensible regulation and infrastructure) caused a significant reaction on the Right, and Buckley was one of the main instigators. <br><br>
Buckley's various interventions (such as support of Joseph McCarthy and the start of the National Review) put in place a number of processes that ultimately set the stage for Reagan, for Gingrich and for Trump. 



Buckley was influenced by the thought of <a
        href="https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=232">Albert
        Jay Nock</a>, and his
relationships and views evolved, including those on the <a

<h3>Option 2 -- <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=862040410969490&ref=watch_permalink">the conversation
                between Joanne
                Freeman and Heather Cox Richardson</a>
</h3>



<p>On May 6, there was a <a href="https://sugsaif.github.io/WH/HCR_Special_5_6_2020.html">conversation</a>
        between historians Joanne Freeman and Heather Cox Richardson sponsored by the Brooklyn Historical
        Society.
        They focused on the effects of language in politics and how it can be used to dominate opponents (whether
        it happens more on the right vs the left), the development of conspiracy theories, how ideologies that emerged
        in the
        aftermath of the civil war affect politics today, why historians are stepping out into the public sphere, and
        why we all
        matter as a public, and (as HCR concluded) that "Democracy is not a spectator sport". <br><br> Language has been
        used by the
        Right very effectively in the last few decades, as <a
                href="https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/wethepodcast/episodes/2017-08-10T06_38_17-07_00">linguist George Lakoff pointed out
                to Keith
                Ellison</a> -- the uniformity in talking points that is often seen in multiple channels and among
        politicians is not
        coincidental, but often the result of systematic training at well-funded organizations like the '<a
                href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/The_Leadership_Institute">Leadership Institute</a>'.
