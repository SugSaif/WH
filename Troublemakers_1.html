<H3>Option 1</H3>

<p>

In her most recent <a href="https://sugsaif.github.io/WH/HCR_History_5_7_2020.html">history
        chat</a>, Heather Cox Richardson covered the development of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_conservatism">movement conservatism</a> in the
mid-20th century to the so-called Reagan revolution.






The pivotal role of William F Buckley became apparent, which generated some discussion in facebook forums. The post-war liberal consensus (which may be characterized as the acceptance of the need for government to provide
social programs, sensible regulation and infrastructure) caused a significant reaction on the Right, and Buckley was one of the main instigators. <br><br>
Buckley's various interventions (such as support of Joseph McCarthy and the start of the National Review) put in place a number of processes that ultimately set the stage for Reagan, for Gingrich and for Trump. 



Buckley was influenced by the thought of <a
        href="https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=232">Albert
        Jay Nock</a>, and his
relationships and views evolved, including those on the <a

(which may be <a

        Trump</a>.
        
        <br><br>
        Buckley also had a series of very famous debates, including
those with <a
        href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2016/10/3/13081784/best-of-enemies-gore-vidal-william-buckley-pbs">Gore

        Kenneth Galbraith</a>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>
        Brainwashing, per se, emerged as a technique in the 1950s after the Korean War in
        the US, and for
        many years secret programs were conducted to develop methods to do this
        more effectively
        using behavioral techniques, isolation, coercion and drugs. One of the
        most notorious of
        the programs (that we know of) was <a
                href="https://www.history.com/mkultra-operation-midnight-climax-cia-lsd-experiments">CIA's
                MK Ultra</a>,
        which utilized the services of a UCLA psychiatrist named <a
                href="https://www.freedommag.org/english/la/issue02/page12.htm?fbclid=IwAR0vURBqqyXGiP-CzUTKXEjiZF12cb2b57PqsFKbLxto9d-nJJLCJWjtcJs">Louis
                Jolyon West</a>. Recently <a
                href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/07/chaos-charles-manson-cia-secret-history-sixties-tom-oneill-dan-piepenbring-review">a
                book came out</a>, whose author Tom O'Neill quite painstakingly and at personal risk brought
        significant
        chunks of the MK Ultra story to view, and in so doing also shed some
        light on the
        Charles Manson saga (aspects that were not covered in the book "Helter Skelter"
        or in the movie "Once
        Upon a Time in Hollywood"). He was recently on <a href="http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/tom-oneill">Joe
                Rogan</a> and on <a href="https://tom-oneill.org/audio-video-for-chaos/">
                other shows and podcasts</a>. Other than
        this book, material on MK Ultra is difficult to find online, although
        there
        are <a href="https://ronaldtammen.com/2019/04/07/mkultra-and-u/">people
                working at the fringes</a>, quietly digging away. Many
        experiments with
        questionable ethics were carried out during this period, and some have
        been <a
                href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/06/harvard-and-the-making-of-the-unabomber/378239/">connected
                to Ted Kaczynski, the Unibomber</a>. Some of these experiments were <a

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>On May 6, there was a conversation between historians Joanne Freeman and Heather Cox Richardson sponsored by the Brookyln
        Historical Society. Both historians are 'public intellectuals' as well in that they have written many books for popular consumption, maintain a social media presence, all while continuing to thrive in their academic careers.  

        <br><br>
        
        The two historicans focused on the effects of language in politics and how it can be used to dominate
        opponents (whether it happens more on the right vs the left), the development of conspiracy theories, how
        ideologies that emerged in the aftermath of the civil war affect politics today, why historians are stepping out
        into the public sphere, and why we all matter as a public, and (as HCR concluded) that "Democracy is not a
        spectator sport".</p>

<h3>Option 4</h3>
<p>In the middle of the 20th century the United States demonstrated that a representational democracy built on the
foundation of a vibrant middle class was possible.
<br><br>
How?
<br><br>
This podcast tells the tale under the conceptual framework of the “liberal consensus”, which while it did not
sufficiently take into the account minority, ethnic, and gender rights, did provide the means for the unprecedented
existence of wealth and income parity for about a half century in the United States. This tale takes shape here through
ongoing dialogues betweenNorman Mailer, William F Buckley and James Badlwin, and a giant in the background, John Maynard
Keynes. We learn about the 'Fair Deal (link), an exchange of essays between Baldwin and Mailer (Baldwin - black boy
looks at a white boy; Mailer - The white negro), Buckley's use of the 'bootstrap' argument, a bygone in television as
exemplified by David Susskind's "Open Mind", and how forces that would have pulled apart the consensus were kept in
check (on the left by threats of 'communism', and on the right by 'anticommunism', which provided a common ground for
conservatives who believed in government institutions, and libertarians, who advocated for limited government). Even the
media buttressed this arrangement by limiting what narratives made progress in the public sphere. Yet the liberal
consensus, with its intrinsic flaws begun to crack, and its critique from the Left in the 1960 provided an opportunity
for the reactionary Right, which through a variety of means, started to take control of the political sphere, with a
resulting erosion of the public commons (both of ideas and of assets). Mailer and Buckley both believed in
individualism, but of different types, the former with an emphasis on self-expression, and the latter on self-interest.
