<H3>Option 1</H3>

<p>

In Heather Cox Richardson's most recent <a href="https://sugsaif.github.io/WH/HCR_History_5_7_2020.html">history
        chat</a>
, she covered the development of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_conservatism">movement conservatism</a> in the
mid-20th century to the so-called Reagan revolution.






The pivotal role of William F Buckley became apparent, which generated some discussion in facebook forums. The post-war liberal consensus (which may be characterized as the acceptance of the need for government to provide
social programs, sensible regulation and infrastructure) caused a significant reaction on the Right, and Buckley was one of the main instigators. <br><br>
Buckley's various interventions (such as support of Joseph McCarthy and the start of the National Review) put in place a number of processes that ultimately set the stage for Reagan, for Gingrich and for Trump. 



Buckley was influenced by the thought of <a
        href="https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=232">Albert
        Jay Nock</a>, and his
relationships and views evolved, including those on the <a

        Birch Society</a>
(which may be <a

<a href="http://www.openculture.com/2011/05/william_f_buckley_flogged_himself_to_get_through_iatlas_shruggedi.html">Ayn
        Rand</a>, leading right-leaning <a

and <a

        Trump</a>.
        
        <br><br>
        Buckley also had a series of very famous debates, including
those with <a
        href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2016/10/3/13081784/best-of-enemies-gore-vidal-william-buckley-pbs">Gore
        Vidal</a>
(<a href="https://sugsaif.github.io/WH/Buckley_Vidal.html
">videos</a>), with <a
        href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1982/1/8/buckley-galbraith-debate-reaganomics-pleading-a/">John
        Kenneth Galbraith</a>
(<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0iq7vktSXVg">video</a>), and with


  James Baldwin at the Cambridge Union that laid down US political lines on race, justice and history <a
                href="https://aeon.co/videos/the-legendary-debate-that-laid-down-us-political-lines-on-race-justice-and-history"
                target="_blank">(video).</a> <br><br>

SUGGESTION (sub-options under Option 1) - a) sample the Vidal/Buckley 1968 debates, b) watch movie <a
        href="https://www.motherjones.com/media/2016/10/exclusive-clip-best-enemies-documentary-gore-vidal-william-buckley/">
        Best of Enemies</a>
, c) watch the 1981 Galbraith/Buckley debate/discussion, or d) watch the Baldwin/Buckley debate of 1965.
