            <p>

In this chat, HCR answered the following questions: 1) Is there any truth to voter fraud (or is it an excuse for
voter-suppression)? 2) Why is the department of justice in the executive branch? Why doesn't the US have national
healthcare? What her thoughts about sexual misconduct charges against Joe Biden? and what about states rights vs
federal government? (the current governor 'pacts' differ from older secessionist movements, e.g. in the early and
mid-19th century, in important ways -- first and foremost, there are no calls for secession; the focus is narrow, the
COVID19 reponse; and the pacts are there to accomplish tasks that the federal authorities have explicitly abdicated)

                         <div class="desc">[From wikipedia] Richardson’s first book, The Greatest Nation of the Earth (1997), stemmed
                             from her dissertation at Harvard University. Inspired by Eric Foner’s work on pre-Civil War
                             Republican ideology, Richardson analyzed Republican economic policies during the war. She
                             contended that their efforts to create an activist Federal Government during the Civil War
                             marked a continuation of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as war bonds
                             and greenbacks or the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act, revolutionized the role
                             of the Federal Government in the U.S. economy. At the same time, these actions laid the
                             groundwork for the Republican Party’s shift to Big Business after the Civil War.</div>

                <div class="desc">In this 2001 book, Richardson "focused on the “Northern abandonment of Reconstruction.” Building
                    on the earlier work of C. Vann Woodward, she argued that a more complete understanding of the period
                    required appreciation of class, not only race. As Reconstruction continued into the 1870s and
                    especially the 1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South more from a class
                    perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their earlier humanitarianism. In
                    the midst of the labor struggles of the Gilded Age, Republicans came to compare “the demands of the
                    ex-slaves for land, social services, and civil rights” to the demands of white laborers in the
                    North. This ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of Reconstruction, as they chose
                    the protection of their economic and business interests over their desire for racial equality."

                    impacted all Americans, not just those in the South. She incorporated the West into the
                    discussion of Reconstruction as no predecessor had. Between 1865 and 1900, Americans re-imagined the
                    role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its citizens. However,
                    racism, sexism, and greed divided Americans, and the same people who increasingly benefited from
                    government intervention—white, middle-class Americans—actively excluded African-Americans, Native
                    Americans, immigrants, and organized laborers from the newfound bounties of their reconstructed
                    nation." [from wikipedia] </div>

                            slaughter of Native Americans in South Dakota in 1890. She argued that party politics
                            and opportunism led to Wounded Knee. After a bruising midterm election, President Benjamin
                            Harrison needed to shore up his support. To do so, he turned to The Dakotas, where he
                            replaced seasoned Indian agents with unqualified political allies, who incorrectly assumed
                            that the Ghost Dance Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one third of its
                            force in order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event, Republicans tried to
                            paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats." [wikipedia] </div>

                        <div class="desc">In this 2014 book, Richardson "extended her study of the Republican
                            Party into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This book studied the entire life
                            of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of George W. Bush.
                            The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” a small group of wealthy white men
                            who controlled all three branches of government. These Republicans articulated a new vision
                            of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War, Republicans
                            began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers and
                            industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar process took
                            place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle successful New Deal policies
                            and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were able to
                            return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first Theodore Roosevelt
                            during the Progressive Era, and then Dwight D. Eisenhower, who enforced integration and
                            maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another
                            fall from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that Republicans
                            treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise from humble
                            beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the original
                            Republicans." [wikipedia]</div>

                             <div class="desc">In her most recent publication, Richardson argues "that America was founded with
                                 contradicting ideals, with the ideas of liberty, equality, and opportunity on one hand,
                                 and slavery and hierarchy on the other. United States victory in the American Civil War
                                 should have settled that tension forever, but at the same time that the Civil War was
                                 fought, Americans also started moving into the West. In the West, Americans found and
                                 expanded upon deep racial hierarchies, meaning that hierarchical values survived in
                                 American politics and culture despite the crushing defeat of the pro-slavery
                                 Confederacy. Those traditions--a rejection of democracy, an embrace of entrenched
                                 wealth, the marginalization of women and people of color--have found a home in modern
                                 conservative politics, leaving the tremendous promise of America unfulfilled." [wikipedia]</div>
