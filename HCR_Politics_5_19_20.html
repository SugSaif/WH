                                In today's chat, HCR covered: 1) why discussions about any government program related to
                                social welfare
                                often get framed as
                                'socialism', 2) the history of the office of the inspector general, 3) her thoughts
                                about Trump's threatened withdrawal
                                of WHO funding, 4) how to negotiate our current polarization.

                                <div class="desc">[From wikipedia] Richardson’s first book, The Greatest Nation of the
                                        Earth (1997), stemmed
                                        from her dissertation at Harvard University. Inspired by Eric Foner’s work on
                                        pre-Civil War
                                        Republican ideology, Richardson analyzed Republican economic policies during the
                                        war. She
                                        contended that their efforts to create an activist Federal Government during the
                                        Civil War
                                        marked a continuation of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as
                                        war bonds
                                        and greenbacks or the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act,
                                        revolutionized the role
                                        of the Federal Government in the U.S. economy. At the same time, these actions
                                        laid the
                                        groundwork for the Republican Party’s shift to Big Business after the Civil War.

                                        required appreciation of class, not only race. As Reconstruction continued into
                                        the 1870s and
                                        especially the 1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South
                                        more from a class
                                        perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their earlier
                                        humanitarianism. In
                                        the midst of the labor struggles of the Gilded Age, Republicans came to compare
                                        “the demands of the
                                        ex-slaves for land, social services, and civil rights” to the demands of white
                                        laborers in the
                                        North. This ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of
                                        Reconstruction, as they chose
                                        the protection of their economic and business interests over their desire for
                                        racial equality."

                                        event that
                                        impacted all Americans, not just those in the South. She incorporated the West
                                        into the
                                        discussion of Reconstruction as no predecessor had. Between 1865 and 1900,
                                        Americans re-imagined the
                                        role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its
                                        citizens. However,
                                        racism, sexism, and greed divided Americans, and the same people who
                                        increasingly benefited from
                                        government intervention—white, middle-class Americans—actively excluded

                                <div class="desc">In this book, published in 2010, Richardson "focused on the U.S.
                                        Army’s
                                        slaughter of Native Americans in South Dakota in 1890. She argued that party

                                        and opportunism led to Wounded Knee. After a bruising midterm election,
                                        President Benjamin
                                        Harrison needed to shore up his support. To do so, he turned to The Dakotas,
                                        where he
                                        replaced seasoned Indian agents with unqualified political allies, who
                                        incorrectly assumed
                                        that the Ghost Dance Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one
                                        third of its
                                        force in order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event,
                                        Republicans tried to
                                        paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats."

                                <div class="desc">In this 2014 book, Richardson "extended her study of the Republican
                                        Party into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This book studied the
                                        entire life
                                        of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of George W.
                                        Bush.
                                        The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” a small group of wealthy
                                        white men
                                        who controlled all three branches of government. These Republicans articulated a
                                        new vision
                                        of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War,
                                        Republicans
                                        began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful
                                        bankers and
                                        industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar
                                        process took
                                        place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle successful New
                                        Deal policies
                                        and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were
                                        able to
                                        return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first Theodore
                                        Roosevelt
                                        during the Progressive Era, and then Dwight D. Eisenhower, who enforced
                                        integration and
                                        maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented
                                        yet another
                                        fall from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that
                                        Republicans
                                        treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise
                                        from humble
                                        beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the
                                        original
                                        Republicans." [wikipedia]</div>

                                <div class="desc">In her most recent publication, Richardson argues "that America was
                                        founded with
                                        contradicting ideals, with the ideas of liberty, equality, and opportunity on
                                        one hand,
                                        and slavery and hierarchy on the other. United States victory in the American
                                        Civil War
                                        should have settled that tension forever, but at the same time that the Civil
                                        War was
                                        fought, Americans also started moving into the West. In the West, Americans
                                        found and
                                        expanded upon deep racial hierarchies, meaning that hierarchical values survived
                                        in
                                        American politics and culture despite the crushing defeat of the pro-slavery
                                        Confederacy. Those traditions--a rejection of democracy, an embrace of
                                        entrenched
                                        wealth, the marginalization of women and people of color--have found a home in
                                        modern
                                        conservative politics, leaving the tremendous promise of America unfulfilled."
