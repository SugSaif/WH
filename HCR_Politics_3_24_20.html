Heather answered three questions today: 1) Can Trump cancel the election, 2) what is the history of the electoral
college, and 3) what might life be like after coronavirus? <br><br>

In the process, she discussed the role of states in federal elections and voter ID laws that have come into being in
many states after the Shelby vs. Holder supreme court decision in 2013. She highlighted two ways the electoral college
of today differs from how it was initially conceived: ‘winner-takes-all' and proportional delegation of votes (that is
the number of delegates each state has is proportional to the population). The ‘winner-takes-all' approach started in
the early 19th century, and the concept of strict proportional delegation ended in 1929, with an act of Congress.
Regarding life after coronavirus, she felt it was possible that we may emerge with a different economic, political and
healthcare systems, which a greater emphasis on infrastructure, social welfare and sensible regulation of business.

                        1845, the 28th US Congress passed "An act to establish a uniform time for holding elections for
                        electors of President and Vice President in all the States of the Union. The act selected "the
                        Tuesday after the first Monday in November" as the day on which all states must appoint
                        electors. This standardization greatly increased the speed of Presidential elections; the
                        previous election of 1844 lasted from November 1-December 4. From 1848 onward, every
                        Presidential election has been held on this date. </blockquote><br>

                        During the Civil War, twenty northern states changed their laws to permit absent soldiers to
                        vote. Before enactment of these statutes, state laws had tethered balloting to the voter's
                        community and required in-person participation by voters. Under the new laws, eligible voters -
                        as long as they were soldiers - could cast ballots in distant military encampments, far from
                        their neighbors and community leaders. </blockquote><br>

                        is characterized by a highly decentralized election administration system. The entities that do
                        the rubber-meets-the-road functions of running an election are typically on the county or
                        city/town level. The state is responsible for certain aspects of elections as well, and the
                        federal government has a role, too. The result is that no state administers elections in exactly
                        the same way as another state, and there is quite a bit of variation in election administration
                        even within states. Each state’s election administration structure and procedures grew
                        organically, as times changed and administering an election became an increasingly complex
                        task. </blockquote><br>

                        of the Jim Crow past are no longer with us, voter suppression remains a mainstay of electoral
                        politics in the United States today. </blockquote><br>

                            College History </a> <br> Quote: The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College in
                        the Constitution, in part, as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in
                        Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. However, the
                        term “electoral college” does not appear in the Constitution. Article II of the Constitution and
                        the 12th Amendment refer to “electors,” but not to the “electoral college.” Since the Electoral
                        College process is part of the original design of the U.S. Constitution it would be necessary to
                        pass a Constitutional amendment to change this system. The ratification of the 12th Amendment,
                        the expansion of voting rights, and the States’ use of the popular vote to determine who will be
                        appointed as electors have each substantially changed the process. </blockquote><br>

                          Quote:Most people believe the Electoral College weighs ballots in states with large
                        populations much less than those in small states. For example, as the Washington Post noted
                        shortly after the election, Wyoming has three electoral votes and a population of 586,107, while
                        California has 55 electoral votes and 39,144,818 residents. Distributing the electoral vote
                        evenly among each state’s residents suggests that individual votes from Wyoming carry 3.6 times
                        more influence, or weight, than those from California. </blockquote><br>

                        stemmed from the 2016 presidential election, in which Hillary Clinton won the highest percentage
                        of votes in Colorado. Micheal Baca, one of the Democratic electors, attempted to cast his ballot
                        in the Electoral College for a different candidate, in violation of state law. Then-Secretary of
                        State Wayne Williams replaced him with another elector, who voted for Clinton. Two other
                        electors, Polly Baca and Robert Nemanich, had previously sought to prevent the state from
                        enforcing its law. Ultimately, there were 10 such “faithless electors” nationwide in the 2016
                        election. </blockquote><br>

                        election of 1824 is most famous for the "corrupt bargain," a deal in the House of
                        Representatives that gave John Quincy Adams the presidency despite his winning fewer popular and
                        electoral votes than Andrew Jackson. But 1824 was also significant for another reason: it was
                        the first election in which the majority of states used a statewide winner-take-all voting
                        method for choosing their presidential electors. </blockquote><br>

                        is that to do so would be to deviate from the wisdom of the Founders of the American political
                        system. But the "Father of the Constitution" himself, James Madison, was never in favor of our
                        current system for electing the president, one in which nearly all states award their electoral
                        votes to the statewide popular vote winner. He ultimately backed a constitutional amendment to
                        prohibit this practice. </blockquote><br>

                        the popular vote or the electoral vote. Andrew Jackson was the winner in both categories.
                        Jackson received 38,000 more popular votes than Adams, and beat him in the electoral vote 99 to
                        84. Despite his victories, Jackson didn’t reach the majority 131 votes needed in the Electoral
                        College to be declared president. In fact, neither candidate did. The decision went to the House
                        of Representatives, which voted Adams into the White House.  In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes won
                        the election (by a margin of one electoral vote), but he lost the popular vote by more than
                        250,000 ballots to Samuel J. Tilden. In 1888, Benjamin Harrison received 233 electoral votes to
                        Grover Cleveland’s 168, winning the presidency. But Harrison lost the popular vote by more than
                        90,000 votes. In 2000, George W. Bush was declared the winner of the general election and became
                        the 43rd president, but he didn’t win the popular vote either. Al Gore holds that distinction,
                        garnering about 540,000 more votes than Bush. However, Bush won the electoral vote, 271 to 266.
                        In 2016, Donald Trump won the electoral vote by 304 to 227 over Hillary Clinton, but Trump lost
                        the popular vote. Clinton received nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump, according to an
                        analysis by the Associated Press of the certified results in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

                        accepted. This was reflected in the energetic growth of Nazi organizations. Ku Klux Klan rallies
                        were common and numerous; Trump’s own father was arrested at one such rally, reportedly while
                        wearing a Klan outfit. A 1941 book found that more than 100 such organizations had formed since
                        1933. The appeal of fascist ideas extended far beyond the fringe, reaching prominent citizens
                        such as Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh. Lindbergh went so far as to praise Adolf Hitler as
                        “undoubtedly a great man.” In 1940, Lindbergh’s wife published a bestseller that called
                        totalitarianism “The Wave of the Future” and an “ultimately good conception of humanity.”

                        concern. So what if it had struck with a vengeance in the Russian capital of St. Petersburg that
                        fall, infecting as much as half the population? Or that it had raged swiftly westward across
                        Europe, into the British Isles? Or that some of the continent’s most prominent leaders—the czar
                        of Russia, the king of Belgium, the emperor of Germany—had fallen ill with the virus? To
                        Americans, it was safely over there, a vast ocean away.  But within a few months, the pandemic
                        spread to virtually every part of the earth. Tracing its path, scientists would observe that it
                        tended to follow the major roads, rivers and, most notably, railway lines—many of which hadn’t
                        existed during last major pandemic in the 1840s. </blockquote><br>

                        economic inequality in the United States has become a central issue in the race for the
                        Democratic presidential nomination, and discussions about policy interventions that might help
                        address it are likely to remain at the forefront in the 2020 general election.  As these debates
                        continue, here are some basic facts about how economic inequality has changed over time and how
                        the U.S. compares globally. </blockquote><br>

                        Harding to be one of America's worst presidents. He is believed to have seen the role of
                        president as mainly ceremonial, leaving government work to subordinates. Revisionists have
                        re-examined his role as an important transition between the Progressive Era and the years of
                        prosperity in the 1920s. Harding is also credited for his broad-minded views on race and civil
                        rights. Historians agree that his negative legacy is not so much attributed to his corrupt
                        friends, but his own lack of vision and poor sense of where he wanted to take the country.

                        country in a whole new direction. The 1932 election had been, in the words of President Herbert
                        Hoover, not a "contest between two men" but one between "two philosophies of government." Hoover
                        believed in small government and letting the free market operate. The Federal Government that
                        Hoover presided over was stunningly limited in scope. Its entire budget was — fiscal
                        conservatives, read it and weep — under $4 billion. Even as the U.S. endured the worst
                        depression in its history, Hoover argued that the answers lay in unfettered capitalism and
                        private charity. </blockquote><br>
